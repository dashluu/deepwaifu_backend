Together with this, Kakeru carries a strong sense of pride and believes in self-reliance, as shown by how he chose to work part-time to support himself instead of relying on the allowance his parents were giving him, since it was his choice to move out of his home.  Kakeru also shows great love and appreciation for food, in part due to him living on his own prior to moving into the dorms, as well as being in a stage of rapid growth and metabolism. However, he isn't selfish and is more than willing to share with others, and is also aware of how he should watch his calorie intake. Kakeru does feel uncomfortable when it comes to his height sometimes, especially due to him now being the shortest among the two groups.

And now there is war. None could know peace without war, victory without defeat, glory without failure. Artio must join those that fight if only to enforce the cycle of things. Nothing and no one defies the laws of nature like a God."
Medusa,"Hatred, vengeful","All monsters are hideous and fearful, but some are worse than others. There is only one whose hair is made of slithering serpents, only one with skin of scales, and only one whose very gaze can turn man, beast, or God to stone. Medusa, the Gorgon.

Stories claim she was beautiful once. A priestess of Athena. Loyal and devout in action, but Poseidon was determined to make her his own. It was the fairness of her features, the golden of her hair, that attracted the Sea God. Medusa, a mortal maiden, could not refuse.

When Athena learned of Medusa's betrayal, she punished the priestess. Those fair features were hideously wrought and those golden locks twisted to hissing vipers. Anyone that met her eyes was petrified – a statue for all eternity.

Medusa fled, frightened, ashamed and furious. For years she hid from the world, nursing a festering hatred for all things, craving beauty but having none, seeing none, until she became the monster she appeared to be.

She slithers now to the field of battle. Those wretched features concealed behind a cruel mask of porcelain perfection, eyes burning from within. All that she perceives, all that is wonderful in this world, she seeks to destroy. Perhaps then she will be the fairest monster of them all."
Terra,"determined, nurturing","Terra Mater, quite literally the mother Earth, rests dormant beneath every living thing. Upon her flesh, trees stand like hairs, rivers weave like veins, and oceans lap against her sides. Long has she slept; since her son, the Titan Saturn, was cast down by his own son. It had all gone so wrong.

At the forging of creation, Terra was split from all other primordial matter to form the earth. Above her, Ouranos, the sky, suspended angelically. She loved him immediately and made him her king. Their children were Titans, beings even more powerful than they. In his fear and jealousy, Ouranos buried the Titans within the earth. Terra began to see the arrogance, the vanity, the hatred in her husband. Conspiring with her children, she freed them and overthrew Ouranos.

Youngest of the Titans, Saturn ruled next. Terra could not have been more proud, but prophecies claimed Saturn would be defeated by his children, just as Ouranos had. To prevent this, Saturn consumed his offspring. All but one. Jupiter escaped, and with righteous fury split Saturn open, unleashing his swallowed siblings. Violently, they defeated the Titans, Terra's children, and claimed the world as their own. Mournful of the children she lost, Terra slept. And ages passed.

But the ravages of a new war have scarred her skin. Her grandchildren, those arrogant, vain, treacherous Gods that stole the world from her son, those Gods, so reminiscent of Ouranos, bleed into her bones with every battle. Now, she finally rises from her slumber. She rises to claim the throne for herself."

Other than Haré, no character seems to be aware of Guu's strange nature (or for that matter the bizarre circumstances surrounding everything else in the series). The weird events that occur because of her are only ever acknowledged by Haré.

Guu's stomach is a world filled with unnatural beings like hundred legged cats, and a nice young couple of lovers that have been trapped there for ages and other versions of her self. Everyone who is eaten by Guu, only to be spat out later (excluding Haré) dismisses what happened as ""sleeping"" (occasionally, dreaming about Guu's Stomach world).

She apparently has more than one stomach and cares enough about the people and creatures she swallows to keep dangerous things away from the area she keeps her 'guests'. Despite all this, Guu actually cares for some of Hare's personal problems, and often gives him advice with profound sayings- a lot of her powers are used to make Hare learn a lesson."

Cathy Graham,"Energetic, Traditional","Cathy is an American girl who dreams of love! Her favorite thing to eat is... hamburgers! Her entire character concept is a reference to THE iDOLM@STER 2 DLC song: Ai LIKE Hamburger; as she evens says the opening line word for word. The hamburger creature seen on her Rare + card was originally featured on the cover art for MASTER ARTIST 02 CD.

It's true her parents are American and she was born in New York City, but she was raised in Japan. She isn't fluent in English and only knows about America from secondhand statements and overboard stereotypes. She's basically a fake American with a Japanese outlook, but actually American. She asks the Producer to help keep all this a secret, hence the nature of her stage act. Onstage, she is a hammy idol from New York who loves hamburgers.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Cathy’s extremely energetic side is on display. Despite being born in America, she grew up in Japan and seems to be very a very traditional girl. As Cathy grew up, she used to get free tangerines from a local fruit shop and decided to incorporate them into her image. She considered making an ice skating unit with her friend Saki Yoshioka, but realized that they would lose the idol aspect if they continued. Her improvisational skills allow her to be scouted by Erika Akanishi, and the two form a comedy duo to rival Suzuho Ueda and Emi Namba. Her act includes her riding a unicycle.

Sayoko Takayama,"Determined, Hot-blooded","At first glance, Sayoko might look just like any other honors student. That's not wrong, however, she's actually more of a hot-blooded type. She's been determined since childhood-- she’d always put her whole heart into things and never give up until the last second. However, Sayoko often lacks self-confidence, believing that she doesn't have any outstanding talents. However, her determination allows her to believe that if she puts as much effort as she can into her work, she can do anything. Sayoko always takes her glasses off when she works, which she says that by doing so, she leaves her weaker self behind with the glasses. To Sayoko, her glasses are a symbol of her weakness. But there's a downside to this as well-- since she doesn't actually wear any contact lenses when she takes her glasses off, her poor eyesight can’t differentiate between a person and a tree, even at close range.

Sayoko also seems to have made a promise to become a famous idol to someone she refers to as “that child”. There is not any information about him or her yet. They seem to have known each other since childhood, hinted at in the summer festival event when Sayoko made a comment about how ""that child"" had always invited her to festivals. No further details were given other than that this was a thing of the past.

While Sayoko belongs to the vocal category, she seems to have a talent for acting. She can almost actually become the role she acts. Interestingly, this talent seems to shine the most when the performance is horror-related. She can even suppress her own mentalities when the role calls for it.

Her family consists of her parents and her little brother. Unlike the always diligent Sayoko, her parents are actually carefree and quite goofy."
Arisa Matsuda,"Energetic, Enthusiastic","The enthusiast idol, Arisa is an energetic girl who is obsessed with idols.

Arisa loves idols very much, maybe too much. She often takes paparazzi photos of them. Her computer is filled with data about idols, and one of the reasons she wants to become an idol is to be able to meet a lot of other idols. But she's also really serious about becoming as close as possible to the idols she admires so much; all of the data she gathers is used for that purpose (and her own enjoyment) and she always puts her best effort into all the work she does. Arisa lacks self confidence, often thinking that she's nothing when compared to other idols, but since she loves idols and really enjoys her work, Arisa continues to work as hard as she can at being an idol."
Akane Nonohara,"Confident, Playful","The annoyingly cute idol among the MILLIONSTARS, Akane is the girl who always says that she's the cutest girl on earth.

Akane is extremely confident. She often talks about how cute she is and how she's great at everything nonstop, encouraging “Pro-chan” to praise “Akane-chan” at least one time a day and she seems to never read the atmosphere at all. Though, it seems that she actually can read atmosphere well, but decides to act this way so that she can stand out and make people around her laugh."
Konomi Baba,"Reliable, Professional","The oldest among the MILLION STARS, also the third shortest idol, Konomi is an easygoing idol who always tried to prove to the Producer and her fans that she is a sexy adult. Because of her short height and youthful looks, most people never take her seriously which always frustrates Konomi to no end. To make matters worse, most of the work the Producer finds for her is for kids.

Aside from her looks and her habit of saying that she is a sexy lady, Konomi is a very reliable adult, often seen taking care of the younger idols (which is everyone), like in the “Idol Symphony” event where Konomi gives advice to Momoko who has been appointed leader of the percussion team to talk with her teammates about what they want to do. She is also very professional and is willing to do her work to the best of her abilities even she doesn't like it. Konomi is also good at office work and offers to lend a hand when the production needs it."
Chizuru Nikaido,"Ambitious, Generous","Chizuru is a 21-year old woman who likes to act like a celebrity, although she's not doing a good job at it. While Chizuru tries her best, she often slips and fails figuratively such as every time she tries laughing in a high pitch voice she ends up coughing, or when she speaks/acts in a non-celebrity-like manner, she then panics and makes bad excuses (""A crowded train is sure a pain… t…thats what I heard!""). Her goal as an idol is to become a top idol and then hold a lavish party at a karaoke bar in front of the train station. Needless to say, only the more innocent idols like Yayoi and Hinata actually believe that she is a celebrity.

Even though Chizuru likes to act like a celebrity, she's doesn't act haughty or act in a “holier than thou“ way. She's actually a generous person who's always kind to everyone and often looks after her fellow idols especially the younger ones. She often gives out high quality breaded cutlet from a restaurant near her house to the other idols. Chizuru is also very diligent, never missing out on a lesson and giving her best effort at work; even if it's only back-dancer work. She also always shows gratitude to everyone who helps her."

Nonetheless, Sheryl is a valuable crew member who is always willing to put herself in dangerous situations to find the answers to her questions."

She, like Mitsuki, is a powerful swimmer in her own right, but feels as if she can never match Mitsuki.

Biography

Early Life

Audrey Page was a normal girl growing up in Platinum City. Her father was famed war hero and ace pilot ""Black"" Jack Page. Having lost her mother at a young age, she grew up a tomboy, learning to work on engines and how to scrap with the best of the boys! But tragedy struck when her father was killed in a terrible crash during an air race. Happening to overhear some suspicious men who had wandered into her father's hanger/garage, she discovered that her father had been murdered by some local mobsters for refusing to cooperate with their match fixing scheme!

After narrowly escaping the racketeers that killed her old man, Audrey wandered, too scared to go home. She eventually fell in with a traveling carnival when she helped the wife of the manager catch a pickpocket. Audrey took to the traveling life with gusto. She even learned tumbling and some acrobatics from some of the side performers.

When her new life was threatened by more mobsters who were putting the squeeze on her new family, she knew she had to act! Sneaking around she managed to track the crooks to their hide out. Not really knowing what to do she got closer to hear their plans but, being a novice, got caught. She put up a tremendous fight but it wasn't enough. Just when it seemed like lights out, a luminous figure crashed through the window: the heroine Silver Queen! Handily dispatching the thugs, the crime-fighter freed the young girl.

Wary that the associates of these criminal fiends would come after the circus folk now that they knew they harbored someone who knew the details of their crimes, Silver Queen adopted Audrey to protect her and her friends.

The Golden Sidekick

After some initial awkwardness as the glamorous socialite/nocturnal crime fighter and the orphan circus brat got familiar with each other, Silver Queen had an inspired idea. Impressed with Audrey's fighting spirit and skills, she invited her to join in the never-ending fight to rid their city of corruption and crime! Inspired by her fathers gold medal for heroism in the war and her new mentors namesake metal, Audrey took on the name Golden Girl! Golden Girl proves invaluable with her mechanical know how and her ability to pilot their custom helicopter the Silver-Swan (name subject to change) and their modified plane: the Gold Eagle.

Audrey's life was really polishing up nicely until puberty arrived. Now, aside from all the usual self image problems, Audrey needs to relearn all her crime fighting acrobatics to compensate for her new center of gravity.

But justice is never easy and a little hormonal imbalance isn't going to stop Silver Queen and Golden Girl from bringing justice to the citizens of Platinum City!

Although he may not look like it, he actually has a sweet tooth, in a bonus room video, he was actually willing to start another war with Etihw because he wanted to get the last bite of mochi kinchaku, thankfully they both were stopped just in time by Wodahs."
Yosafire,"Fervent, loyal","Fervent, lively, impulsive, and only slightly irresponsible makes Yosafire headstrong and tends to give her an impression of being stubborn, exhibited in the fact that she is always the first to act and the last to give in despite all odds against her. Her ability to place her trust even in people she’s only just met is one of her admirable qualities that also makes her an affable character.

Overall, Yosafire is an earnest, often intent individual who, despite her erroneous view of the Worlds, is very adaptable to new situations and places, and is quick to find solutions to problems that are presented to her. However, it could be said that Yosafire is, surprisingly, just as quick to realize her mistaken understanding of the Worlds’ ways, but still holds strong on her opinion that everyone should not be chained to casteism.

While filled with indignation toward those who mistreat her and her friends, she never seems to express any true resentment; in fact, the only time she has ever been shown outraged is when she denounces Ivlis for harming Kcalb and badmouthing him. But surprisingly enough, Yosafire is quite against the idea of needless violence, and would rather steer clear from a situation requiring it.

She is loyal to those she cares about, and will strive in keeping them happy and in high morale, especially in the most dire situations. The best example is in her relationship with Kcalb, where, despite knowing of his past deeds, is still very much willing to accept him as he is and with no changes in her love and care for him.

Yosafire also has a tendency to use childish insults, sometimes even vulgar ones"

Her goal is to created a new bread of humans.
She's a lunatic who has no reservations about using herself as a test subject to reach her goal. The shield generator that uses the invader's superior regenerative abilites and her application of invader tentacles (which can freely change in volumen) to weapons, however, are true scientific genius."

Bastet,"Fierce, Regal","Reveling in the joys of life, Bastet, daughter of Ra, is the sensual embodiment of her feline form. This cat, however, has the fiercest claws.Cats are creatures that demand worship. They are regal, nonchalant, and insatiable. Though, as much as they languish in the sun and rumble with purrs of pleasure, cats are agile and deadly hunters. Mercilessly, they cull the populations of invasive vermin and stinging scorpions, protecting the home from vile invaders. Perhaps, the most troublesome enemy of the cat is the serpent, and there was no greater snake in the world than the horrendous Apep.Circling the world along the horizon line, Apep’s scaly girth waited in ambush each morning for Ra to rise and bring light to the world. To fend off this beast, Ra kept the company of his daughter, Bastet. Since time began, as Ra lifted into the Eastern sky, Bastet would spit and howl, claws bared against the treacherous Apep. Countless battles were fought, countless mornings faced uncertainty, until, at last, Bastet tore the foul serpent apart.With her greatest enemy gone, Bastet is free to prowl as she pleases. Now, she is the guardian of home and hearth, idol to women - especially those desiring children and exploring their sensuality - and patron of arts, wine, and any occasion of revelry. Like any cat, though, Bastet can still pounce without warning, shredding her enemies once her claws come out."

At night, he slipped into her temple and scrawled poetry across the walls espousing his undying love. This defilement could not go unanswered. Nu Wa summoned the most conniving and wicked Fox Spirit she could and thrust it upon the Emperor with intent to spiral his life into misery. Little did Nu Wa know what she had just unleashed.

For thousands of years the nine-tailed Fox spirit had lived, biding its time, honing its malicious appetites. Finally in human form, it assumed the irresistible guise of Da Ji, and to Emperor Zhou, she could do no wrong.

With free reign of the empire and its people, Da Ji reveled in torture and malice. She took delight in their screams of pain and she danced to playful music composed at her command, the musicians trembling for every note.

So grievous did these atrocities grow that the people rose up and overthrew their ruler. they stormed the gates, toppled the throne, and pursued Zhou to his bed chamber, where the crazed emperor finally took his own life.

Yet, Da Ji managed to escape and conceal herself. Now she joins the fray, not to save the universe, nor empower her pantheon, but instead to soak up every last cry of anguish from her enemies."
Isis,"Brave, Tenacious","When Isis was born, she was a Goddess. When she was married, she became a Queen. But a legendary journey to resurrect her murdered husband would make her a savior.

From the God of Earth and Goddess of Sky, Isis was born, and she was a Goddess in her own right, loved by wealthy and poor alike, champion to sinners and slaves, artisans and aristocrats. She commanded the force of magic, for she knew the True Names of many things. For in the True Names lie true power.

Isis and her husband Osiris ruled Egypt, symbols of order and justice, and led their kingdom to true prosperity. But Osiris had a brother, Set, who harbored jealousy and malice, and sought to usurp his throne. For him, murder alone was not enough. Set hacked Osiris to pieces and cast them across Egypt.

Fleeing Set’s wrath, Isis traveled the land in secret, gathering the remains of her husband. Meanwhile, Set’s rule plunged the land into chaos incarnate, and all seemed truly lost. Unable to locate a final piece, Isis could wait no longer and summoned the potent powers of her magic to reassemble her husband and give him new life. That night, their love became a child, Horus, who would avenge his father and cast evil Set out of Egypt.

Her bravery, tenacity, her skill and love drove Isis to save Egypt and become the mother of all Pharaohs. Long has she prayed that chaos would never again rise to threaten the rule of order and prosperity, but peaceful days are at an end. This time, it may not be her husband torn asunder, but all the world, and even the Goddess of Magic may not have the power to reassemble it from oblivion."
Nemesis,"Justice, Retribution","Of arrogance and pride, the Greeks have but one word: hubris. It is a crime against Gods and Men, but a crime many commit with impunity. Even mighty Zeus is guilty. But when punishment is due, there is one from whom even the God of Thunder shrinks. She is Nemesis, the red-washed blade of Divine Retribution.

Recall the tale of Narcissus, so taken by his own beauty. Proudly, his visage was flaunted, to the detriment of all. Until, at last, he was led to a pond of crystal hue where his own reflection enraptured him. So long did he remain to gaze upon this self-image that hunger claimed his life. Thus does Nemesis respond to hubris. It is consequence equal to the crime.

Now, behold the war torn land, beset by the wrath of wanton Gods filling the air with blood and boasts. This battlefield is stained with hubris. Unwittingly, these foolish warriors have summoned their greatest adversary. Nemesis has come!

No longer will foul deeds engender success, no hoard of wealth held in undeserving hands, no legends told when falsely earned. Nemesis will unleash a tide of retribution. Punishment for the crime of hubris is death."
Nike,"Courageous, Inspiring","It is often said that history is written by the victor. If that is true, then history is shaped by a single Goddess: Nike, the winged warrior.

When the fastest runner bears a golden medal, when a cunning hunter slays the fiercest beast, when the soldiers seize the day, the Faithful of Olympus praise Nike. Without her favor, failure is ensured, and obscurity certain.

Even mighty Zeus, a king among Gods, seeks the favor of Nike. On the smoke strewn fields of antiquity, when the God of Thunder marched against his Titan forebears, Nike fought by his side, her dauntless blade inspiring confidence in her allies as they faced an impossible foe. Without her, all the heavens are left to wonder if Zeus would have carried that day. Had Zeus fallen, the world as it is known would have fallen with him.

So, all hail the victor! She has finally taken the field. As Gods and Gorgons clash and battles most fierce and foul are fought, she alone shapes the day. For history is written by the victor, and Nike is victory incarnate."
Kali,"Fierce, Destructive","To speak of Kali is to speak of the beginning of time itself.

Across the majestic lands of Hindustan rose an army of demons that conquered the countryside and slaughtered the people. Yet, when the Gods themselves were defeated, Devi, the supreme Goddess, emerged to throw back this host and protect the faithful.

Three forms she took during these ancient times. The first, Durga, the Mother of Creation, was as radiant as she was fearsome. Astride her tiger, she scattered the demon horde until she encountered the horrendous Raktabija. For each wound she gave the demon, his cursed blood created a copy, quickly resulting in an unstoppable army of Raktabija clones. Rage boiled at the corners of Durga's mind, in the quest to slaughter and destroy evil. From the forehead of Durga sprung her wrathful form, with skin darkened and eyes glowing a menacing red.

Thus was Kali, the Black One, Goddess of Time and Destruction, the second form of Devi born.

Rarely has Kali been seen since, kept in the shadows of Devi's mind, but when the tides of battle shift and evil looms large, there is no solution but unrestrained destruction of evil, and Kali once again, walks the Earth."
Freya,"Proud, Strong","Valkyries, the elite and angelic warriors of the Nordic Pantheon, are as beautiful and dangerous as a midnight winter storm. Yet their queen, Freya, so irresistibly desirable, so uncompromising in warfare, make the Valkyries seem nothing more than plain paper dolls. She’s the object of desire for every God, every man, and the envy of every woman. Even the Frost Giants crave her for their own, often devising devious plans to trick or force her into marriage. But Freya is proud and strong, with the cunning to escape her enemies and ruthlessly retaliate. Every rose bears thorns, but this one wields swords.

Were it up to her, Freya would have little to do with blood and blades. Her name literally means “the lady,” and none of more worthy of the title. She adores bright flowers, pleasant company, and the sweet lilt of a sad love song. She’s sensual and amorous, invoked by worshipers seeking to bear a child or find a lover. Ruler of the realm of Sessrumnir, a place much like Valhalla, where the souls of dead warriors spend eternity, Freya provides comfort and bliss to the fallen.

Once, Freya was married to the mysterious and elusive God, Od. Immediately following their wedding, Od went on a journey to distant and inhospitable lands. So long was he gone the Gods presumed him dead. Distraught and heartbroken, Freya spilled tears of gold and searched the globe for him. Finally, she discovered him ship-wrecked and twisted into a hideous sea monster. Melancholy but loyal, she stayed and comforted him. Though one night, while she slept, a daring hunter slew the beast Od had become. Moved by Freya’s utter despair, the Gods agreed to allow Od into Sussrumnir, despite the fact he had not died in battle, so he and Freya could remain together forever."

For casual wear to look more normal, she's has been seen in a light yellow top and a green miniskirt and sandals.

When she first met Kenichi, she showed to be a kind and cheerful person and a bit playful. Like Kenichi, Raichi loves flowers and was interested on how Kenichi new so much about it. In battle, Raichi was originally very aggressive and brutal in combat, showing no mercy to Kisara or the other member of Shinpaku Alliance. She was also quiet, rarely speaking unless she chose to. She can also be taunting, making fun of Kisara for having small breasts by groping her own.

She is also insulted that Kenichi wouldn't hurt her due to her being a girl, stating it shouldn't matter in a fight. However, unlike her father, she doesn't desire to kill others and only wants to end things peacefully and only knock out her enemies. When Kenichi tried to end things peacefully due to him seeing how kind she is deep down from their time from before, Raichi, moved by his compassion, sheds tears of sadness over her situation of having to kill him and choose to give up revealing that deep down she doesn't want to kill others and is forced to thanks to Yomi.

After her fight with Kenichi, Raichi has become much nicer and friendly and more helpful such as helping Kenichi and Miu take out the bomb on the ship where Diego Carlo was fighting. Also, she seems to have developed a crush on Kenichi, such as blushing around him and grabbing his arm after the fight, causing Miu to get jealous.

Having been trained in Chinese Kenpo for a long time, Raichi is a very strong opponent for her age. So much that she was able to easily overwhelm the Shinpaku main members such as Kisara, Ukita and even Siegfried with ease (albeit he held his own until he was distracted by her sparks). Even against Kenichi she was able to put up a good fight and give him a hard time (though this was due to his refusal to hurt women). Due to her size, she's very agile and able to outmaneuver her enemies with ease."

Wodahs,"Hardworking, Sadistic","Wodahs comes off as a solitary, hardworking, and impassive individual. He is staunch to the Gray Garden's God and Devil pair (to Kcalb especially). He does what he pleases and exerts authority over both colleagues and superiors–doing this on a day-to-day basis is giving him stomach pains.

He tends to his flowers religiously and knows how to bake and cook, one of his favourite dishes being ochazuke. Wodahs leans toward becoming upset when Etihw and Kcalb fight with the war prior to the events of The Gray Garden in mind, or if his work is tampered with (e.g. nearly breaking Grora's leg for ruining his flowerbeds). Surprisingly, he has a tad bit of a sadistic side; enjoying his brother's apologetic face whenever the Devil looks upon the wound he once inflicted on Wodahs.


Wodahs is the younger brother of Kcalb and the Head Angel of the Gray Garden. He fought in the Great War between angels and demons, and was evidently on Etihw's side. Near the end of the war, Kcalb and Etihw had a great battle, and during said battle, it is said that Kcalb injured Wodahs' right eye–rendering it useless.

It was Wodahs' words that pierced Etihw's heart and convinced both the God and Devil to change for the better and create a better world. He now refuses to heal his eye to serve as a constant reminder to them of the consequences of war, as he himself stated in a Bonus Room video."

She was Meikai's familiar and the one Meikai had chosen to wield the Sacred Sword, she remained as his familiar up until his supposed death. In the past, she had longer hair and wore a red kimono instead of a white one.

Respecting her master's wishes, Tatsumiya filled the role of parent for Wadanohara, in place of her absent father and mother.

This causes Maria and Lashara to be frequently embarrassed by her antics. At one point, they attempted to get retribution by using Kenshi's hypnotized state on her, in which he gives massages that can cause intense orgasms, sometimes hours or days after they are delivered, causing the young girls deep embarrassment since even a slight touch after the massage will cause them to have more intense orgasms. But, to Lashara and Maria's shock, it backfired when they realized that the Queen liked it... a lot! Afterwards, Flora developed a large, although clingy, crush on Kenshi, mostly due to his massage.

Shaula, like her older sibling Medusa, shares an interest in experimental research, driven by the singular interest in destroying the organization known as DWMA[sourcing needed]. It is since she seemed to have developed into a strong sense of ambition but at the cost of her becoming both boastful and conceited. Rather like Medusa, she remains composed even while being dismissive of her previous experiments, especially of those whom are not deemed useful any longer. She seems to be using these Traitors as prototypes to further the creation of a being capable of defeating the students of DWMA, an objective which is strangely similar to those of her relations. She also seems to share Arachne's fondness of lavish and high-quality things, demonstrated by the various furnishings that adorn her initial office.

Shaula is a sinister individual, having immense hatred against those align with the DWMA. She holds no remorse in manipulating others with mind control to her own means and even seems to enjoy doing so. Rarely, has she been seen losing her composure much like her sisters. She's not above taking advantage of others much like her sisters. She's seems to have no regard for taking any sort of human life & takes joy in taking it. She finds the concept of friendship and compassion meaningless, looking at it as humans trying to fill a void in their heart. She even finds the concept of a Soul Resonance foolish and hypocrisy from DWMA.

Shaula, unlike her sisters, demonstrates all the qualities of a typical teenage girl rather than those of a mature woman, leading to the assertion that she is the youngest amongst her two siblings. Her pale and unblemished complexion serves to accentuate her slender facial features, which are characterized by the unusual iris displayed by both of her eyes, a trait seemingly shared by all the members of her immediate family. Alluding to her scorpion theme, this distinctive feature takes the shape of two interlocking scorpion stingers, which together form one complete circle located at the center of each eye (which also looks like the yin yang to some viewers). Continuing with this motif, her floral patterned or headscarf covered hair is arranged into a long loose plait that ends in the shape of a scorpion's stinger, through the use of an appropriately tied bow, an aspect that is further mirrored by an ornamental earring dangling from her right ear.

Befitting her age, Shaula's typical attire consists of a long-sleeved sailor outfit that has been adopted by many Japanese schools as their standard uniform. However, unlike most variations, hers displays the symbol of the star sign ""Scorpio"" (♏) as a small emblem, located on the visible portion of her vest beneath her sailor collar. This collar has two stripes running across it, one that goes along its entirety and another that terminates partway across the front."

She entered into a cold sleep and has been sleeping for 800 years leading to the events of Light Novel Volume 4 of the light novel. However, after encountering Sora in Light Novel Volume 5, she has awoken from her cold sleep and has willingly joined Oceando, along with the Seirens and Dhampir, into an alliance with the Elchea Federation.

Like other Seiren, she is mainly humanoid with dress like fins on her feet and pointed ears. She has wavy blue hair and a youthful face. Has a snow-white body that is decorated with strips of gold. The lower half of her body has attractive scales on it, which reflect the light in the room.

She is bored with life and seeks 'pure love' as she was born with everything: wealth, beauty and 'love' from anyone. She does not seem to care for how long she had been sleeping (V5C4). She also likes to reject people when they are deeply in love with her in a most brutal way.

Turns out, her definition of ""pure love"" is ""unobtainable love"" in which no matter how much she loves the other person, the person will not reciprocate it back. As such, it was the goal of her game to find this ""unobtainable love"" (in which Shiro found out before Sora despite deciphering people's intentions supposedly being his strength). After Sora defeated her, she has since fallen in love with him to the point of even calling him her ""Prince"" or, ""Emperor"".

As a Seiren, she has the ability to manipulate the water spirits within her body. This enables her to attract the spirits within other living things generating something similar to ""seduction magic"". However, due to the abnormally large amount of water spirits contained within her, Laira's ability to attract spirits is greatly enhanced even to the point of being able to seduce Sora and Shiro's group with the exception of Sora and Shiro themselves.

Laira, like any other Seiren, is also able to undergo a cold sleep in which she can sleep continuously for a thousand years or more. She does this by encasing herself in ice (it is unknown whether being frozen is necessary to undergo cold sleep) and has therefore been asleep like this for 800 years until the events of Light Novel Volume 5."

That night, she threw a garbage bag onto Robin through a portal and discovered that Robin was living in the dumpster.

The following day, Raven and her new teammates confronted Kid Flash and the three Titans East members (Speedy, Aqualad and Bumblebee) but the five were defeated by him rather quickly because of the robot which Kid Flash sent out to attack them even though she teamed up with Starfire. As the robot was disintegrated by Cyborg's newly gained laser, she cheered for Cyborg with her teammates. Later on, the five tried to get back the tower by distracting Kid Flash with a race and blocking the elevator door with planks, but Kid Flash was faster. Shortly after Robin broke Kid Flash's knee, she threw him out of the tower with Starfire, Beast Boy and Cyborg, hence officially joining the Teen Titans and as time pass, she would then gradually develop romantic feelings for fellow teammate Beast Boy despite his constant annoyance.

He is also playful and fun-loving. While he dislikes and is weak against obligation, and often pushes some of this tasks as Procellarum's leader to Kai, he can actually work very earnestly, although it is unknown what he thinks about during those moments. Because of his upbringing as the sole child of the once-powerful Shimotsuki family, he is a real-life ""rich boy"" or a ""princeling"", or someone who has had a rather pampered upbringing, he also comes off as somewhat spoiled, and is weak to manual labor.

Doremi and co. all sacrificed their witch powers to save her, and in turn, they had to give up their powers once more and lose custody of Hana-chan.

In Motto, Hana-chan reappeared when she was given to Momoko by Oyajide. Neither knew each other, so they had some bonding time while Doremi and the others were in the Majokai.

Her standards of what is appropriate for a Yamato Nadeshiko and what is not is somewhat strange, like how she considers all idols to be Yamato Nadeshiko, or how she tries her best to not use any foreign words (except when she's excited or surprised). She speaks in a very peculiar way, using complicated Japanese terms and words rather than ones more normal for her age. She calls the Producer ""shikakenin-sama"" (仕掛け人様, instigator) and a pom-pom ""sukedachi tamafusa"" (助太刀玉房/ which means something along the line of “a ball that is used to assist/cheer”). To say that Emily has great love for Japan’s culture might actually be an understatement; Emily is really serious about truly becoming a Yamato Nadeshiko and tries her best to act as one, but this might just be because she moved to Japan recently."
Tamaki Ogami,"Innocent, Energetic","The wild child of the MILLION STARS, Tamaki seems to come from a rural place, as she is incredibly fond of nature and she often swims in the river and captures lizards and insects. There's also no other kids her age where she lives, so she became an idol because she heard that doing so would help her make many friends.

It wouldn't be too far-fetched to call Tamaki the most child-like child among the younger idols-- she is innocent, energetic, and full of curiosity. Tamaki likes to play outdoors, watch sentai shows, and likes pretending to be the leader of a sentai squad. She also loves all kinds of animals (including frogs and insects), which is why she gets along especially well with Umi Kousaka and Hibiki Ganaha.

Momoko, while one of the youngest idols, probably has more experience in the entertainment industry than any of her fellow idols and that has made her know about the less than beautiful part of the industry. It’s no surprise that Momoko always acts in such a bitter and arrogant way towards everyone as she believes that everyone is trying to use her for their own end. Thus, Momoko always tries to put distance between herself and her co-workers, saying that they only have a business-like relationship with each other.

To make matters worse, Momoko doesn't have a happy family either, since her parents seem to be fighting each other all the time. It’s no wonder that Momoko hates family events like Christmas and in the event “Idol Symphony” when the Producer said that he would invite her parents to come watch her, Momoko replied that it’s unnecessary since they will only fight each other. It’s also hinted that Momoko’s family was just a normal happy family before she debuted.

Despite her attitude, Momoko is still just a child and a kind one at that. She often shows concern over her fellow idols and acts in a way that would suit a child her age from time to time. Furthermore, Momoko also wants to have fun with other kids, but because she's busy with work as a child star, Momoko never has many opportunities to play with other kids her age and learn how to make friends. When she opens her heart to the Producer, she'll really trust and get attached to him. She'll also show her childish side more often, though she never completely ditches her high and mighty attitude.

Although her life until now was less than happy, after becoming an idol, Momoko's life seems to have taken a turn for a better. She manages to become friends with Iku Nakatani and starts to trust her fellow idols. A smile of happiness starts to return to her face and she starts to become more open towards others, as evident in the “summer festival” event where Momoko told the Producer that she had a talk with one of the girls that came to the festival and found out that the girl also likes to collect stickers, so she traded some of her stickers with that girl. They also promised to dance a bonfire dance with each other. Megumi Tokoro and Konomi Baba comment that Momoko has a really innocent smile that suits a child her age when she dances with the other kids. Konomi also adds that Momoko also has that smile when she's with the Producer."
Iku Nakatani,"confident, childish","The youngest of the MILLION STARS, don’t say that to her though, since Iku hates to be treated like a kid.

Iku is quite a precocious child; she is confident that she can do any work without any help from the Producer and she always wants to know the details of her lesson. She is still a child nonetheless, as she's happy when she does work she likes, cries when she's frustrated and becomes really happy when her mother praises her. A lot of her dialogue also shows that Iku is still very much childish, no matter how mature she tries to act."

Developed based on the AR-15 weapon frame, Honey Badger was intended to be a more suitable replacement for close quarter weapon systems such as MP5.

Developed with a standard M4 upper and lower receiver, it features a shorter barrel with a higher twist rate, gas impingement system cycle is modified to be very short. Designed specifically to chamber the AAC .300 BLK cartridge, Honey Badger achieves a cyclic rate of fire of around 800 rounds per minute, while feeding on STANAG magazines of various capacities.

Honey Badger has a specially designed integrated suppressor. The suppressor can be removed but firing accuracy will be drastically reduced. With the subsonic cartridge Honey Badger fires, the noise generated from shooting is even lower than most similar products suppressed weapons on the market. The weapon itself does not come with any factory default iron sights, but has Picatinny rails atop and below the hand-guard to mount iron sights, optics and other accessories such as a fore-grip. It also features an adjustable stock.

Unfortunately, in 2013 Freedom Group who owned AAC at the time announced that they would be leaving the ""rifle-making business"", focusing more on suppressors and related accessories. Following this, the Honey Badger failed to meet deadlines for military feed backs and adjustments, it's intended service contract with the US SOCOM was taken by SIG Sauer's MCX instead. Failing to gain the procurement contract, Brittingham departed AAC, forming his own company to marketed the Honey Badger to the civilian gun owners/enthusiasts instead.

Before coming to Hiroshima, she was a short-tempered tomboy, but secretly desired to make friends in the country. She now has a cheerful, outgoing personality, but according to Haruto, she often hides her feelings from others. Although her sunny disposition causes her to constantly joke around and tease her friends, she is fiercely loyal to her companions. She is also rather messy and disorganized, complimenting her carefree nature."
Kiyomi Yura,"stern, haughty","Kiyomi is a tall, voluptuous girl often wearing a stern expression on her face. She has long black hair going down to her waist and straight-cut bangs across her forehead.
Kiyomi is stern and rather haughty, but shows a softer side with many of the people that she cares for. She is also very poor at holding in or hiding her feelings, letting people know exactly what she thinks both physically and verbally (and perhaps a little uncontrollably and excessively) whether she wants to or not. Because of this, her austere disposition is often betrayed and the majority of the cast (except for the hapless Takashi Yura) can tell what is going on in her head after just a few meetings."
Asuka Mizunokoji,"Fearful, Affectionate","Due to her isolation from men and from meeting Ataru, she develops a fear of men. However, she loves her older brother like a lover and Mendou because they care for her."

Iono Tomonaga,"Shy, Frustrated","The best friend of Hakone. She has a crush on Sento and is struggling to confess to him, but Sento seems to be unaware of it and only thinks of her as a little sister, much to her frustration."
Jing Wei,"Determined, resolute","Against the red rising sun, a winged form sweeps out to sea, claw clutched around a pebble. With focused grit, she hurls the small stone into the watery maw, circling above as it sinks into darkness. Resolved, she turns back to collect another. Jing Wei will not cease until the ocean is filled. That is her oath. And she will not break an oath.

Once, she was a young girl, a princess, enamored by the glory of the morning light. She gazed in wonder as her father, Yan Di, the Flame Emperor, shepherded the sun from the eastern sea. Desperately, she longed to reach the place where it emerged, but her father refused take her on the waters.

One night, the princess sailed out alone, secretly hoping for a clear view come the dawn. But the waters were churning in a storm. Mountainous waves crashed into her tiny ship. The sea swallowed her whole.

Yan Di woke and coaxed the sun from the horizon, only to find the shattered remains of his daughter's boat upon the shore.

Yet, even as he grieved, a bright goddess burst from the ocean and soared overhead. ""Jingwei!"" she cried, and Yan Di knew his daughter was reborn.

Though given a second chance that day, Jing Wei swore an oath against the seas that took her life. She would fill them with stone until they were gone. An impossible task. But Jing Wei swore an oath. And Jing Wei will not break an oath."
Isumi Saginomiya,"kind, soft-spoken","Isumi is a black-haired girl who is always wearing a kimono. Another one of Nagi's close friends, she and Nagi met at a party a long time ago. When all the other children, Sakuya included, laughed at Nagi's first attempt at writing her own manga, Isumi took interest in it and asked Nagi how it ends; Nagi then asked Isumi (in a childish sense) to marry her. Like Nagi, Isumi is very rich. Unlike Nagi, Isumi is soft-spoken, kind, and can cook well. While she does not have an awful sense of direction, she constantly gets lost due to the fact that she is apt to forget her destination, though she is able to disappear from people's eyes instantaneously. She has feelings for Hayate and does not wish to see him sad."
Kazamori Sasa,"Analytical, Adaptive","Kazamori is an Artificially Intelligent robot called a RAI. Created by Sasa Komamori, Kazamori cannot harm another being, but can perfectly copy a human thought and has the ability to data transfer/download itself wirelessly at a high speed to anything that is electronic. Kazamori is one of the last RAI built by Komamori before they were outlawed. After Komamori is arrested, Kazamori moves his consciousness to a doll of a girl so he can continue living."

Awilix,"Mysterious, commanding","Pale white shines the light from her sentinel high above Earth. She watches, the eye that pierces shadow, and listens with the ears of birds and beasts that use the darkness to hunt and revel. As Queen of the Night, she is known; the Goddess of the Moon, Awilix.

They say the sun is her lover, and from his light does she shine, but those that say so have never beheld her. Left unrestrained, the sun burns skin, scorches the land, blinds the eyes. Moonlight does no such thing. Like soft white petals it blankets the night, casting the world into mystical illumination. Never has it brought calamity or ruin, only the chance to see where once there was none. She is no different. Her mysterious radiance needs no other to shine.

These days, the night is less welcoming. Those loyal followers, the jaguars, whose whispered roars bellow into the silence of her domain, prowl at her command. While it is, no doubt, beyond the understanding of mortals, the very moonlight is threatened. A war unlike any before it would end all things. For once that pale white will glimmer on the ugliness of bloodshed, for the night belongs to Awilix."
Lunara,"clever, playful","The dryads watch over the shadowed forests of Kalimdor. Fleet-footed, clever, and playful, they protect their home with tender loving care. But where her sisters are the delicate flowers of the deep forest, the dryad Lunara, first daughter of the demigod Cenarius, is the thorn that guards them. Lunara nimbly strikes from afar, withering her enemies with toxins, then bounds away before anyone can lay a hand on her. Take care if you face her, or Lunara will make an endangered species out of you! Lunara's father named her after her grandmother."
Go Go Tomago,"Adventurous, Bold","A tomboyish mechanical engineer, her mag-lev skates allow her move with great speed and flexibility and she has mag-lev discs that can also be used as shields or thrown weapons. Go Go is a Korean American. The moniker ""Go Go Tomago"" is a nickname given by her teammate, Fred; her real name is unrevealed. She constantly chews gum, only stopping when it's time to get serious."
Right Wink,"Apathetic, Deadpan","Right Wink is noticeably low energy and marginally confused in any given Wink album cover or music video. This is why she is beloved by many. Right Wink may have more vocals, but beneath her deadpan face you can see the purest essence of apathy peeking out.

Such an earnest display connects Right Wink and her fans on a fundamental level: no longer being willing or able to give a fuck.

Bonnibel,"gentle, witty","Bonnibel is the seventh girl unlocked in the game. She is unlocked after having level 10 at the Dancing (Suave) hobby. You encounter her making cakes in the local bakery. As you carelessly drop coins on the floor, she slips up and crushes the cake she was working on, resulting in a sight that would not look too out of place from an anime scene...

Bonnibel speaks in a southern belle accent and loves to bake. In general, she loves to talk about food. She is gentle and calm, but also witty. This is particularly noticeable in the allegoric comparisons she makes with dating and baking. Her preference in dating witty and smart men further alludes to this.

Bonnibel also holds an interest in artists, or 'refined' people as she would say. This is mostly evident due to her job requirements for dating."
Tsukishima Kyou,"lively, cheerful","Junior student at Hoshioka Gakuen and the protagonist’s classmate.

Kyou was the ace of the basketball club, but because she was busy helping out at home, her club activities have been put on hold.

She is a very lively and cheerful girl and will do anything that comes to mind with impunity. In addition, she is friendly with both genders which often causes misunderstandings.

Her family runs a pizza delivery shop. Once pizza is mentioned, she will talk nonstop, but be warned… if someone shows contempt towards pizza in front of her, she will go ballistic. While she likes making fun of the protagonist, she also lets him work at the pizza shop."
Momou Inugami,"masochistic, submissive","Momou is a masochistic dog god that Momiji usually summons. He has sharp senses of smell and hearing, and is capable of transforming into a chihuahua, though he is forced back into human form if he experiences too much pleasure, masochistic or otherwise. For example, when Ichiko tickles Momou in the bath, he accidentally changes back into human form. Due to his masochistic nature, Momou can withstand excruciating pain. Even when Ichiko beats him with a bathtub, he begs her to keep going."
Yomi,"perverted, aggressive","Yomi has a perverted nature, shown as she ripped off Musubi's clothes instead of fighting her seriously. Despite of this character she accuses Minato to be a pervert as he tried to hold her to protect Kusano. She also attacked Sahashi Takami, one of the leading figures in MBI, without mercy and injured her left eye when she first tried to get a hold of Kusano."
Oriha,"Playful, Tenacious","Oriha Sekirei #101, speaks in a sing-song voice. She fights using several bladed disks and fears snakes. Fought against Tsukiumi while trying to acquire Homura for Izumi[1]. During the third stage she fought against Haihane (of the Disciplinary Squad) and was seemingly defeated by her, but reappeared later and attacked Minato, who was barely saved by Homura. She faced off against Tsukiumi in a rematch of their previous battle in Norito mode, but was overwhelmed and easily defeated and terminated by Tsukiumi's Norito."
Yashima,"Resilient, Strong","Sekirei #84, had an abusive Ashikabi who treated her as nothing more than a possession. She fought using a massive hammer. Despite using a Norito (chant) to power up, she was defeated by Shiina and lost her Sekirei Crest"
Karasuba,"Assertive, Conflict-prone","Karasuba is the leader of the third generation Disciplinary Squad. In the past she was a member of the first generation Disciplinary Squad and teamed up with Yume in the second generation Disciplinary Squad. She seems to know a lot about Musubi's past and knows about many parts of the Sekirei Plan from her job and from the fact that she has been around as long as Miya, Matsu and Kazehana. Karasuba and Miya do not associate well with each other as the latter does not allow her to set foot in Izumo Inn. The last time she did, they came close to fighting at the mere appearance of the other."
Pele,"Destructive, Creative","Pele is the goddess of Fire, of Dance and Wind, of Volcanoes and Violence. Those who worship Pele speak of her as Madame Pele or Tutu Pele, while others know her as Ka wahine ’ai honua, ’the woman who devours the land’. Though she is capable of great acts of destruction, and possesses the tempter to provoke such acts, Pele is both destroyer and creator. It was through her mastery over the world's molten core that she wrought the Hawaiian Islands into being, forging them from the lava that ruptured forth from the mouths of her volcanoes. They are places of immense beauty, lush and brimming with life, and by looking upon and revelling in such beauty, you offer Pele worship.

Born of Kane Milohai, who wrought the earth, sky and heavens, and the Earth goddess Haumea, Pele is one of the fourteen children, seven sisters and seven brothers. It is from the enmity between these siblings that Pele arrived in Hawaii, after her exile at the hands of Kane Milohai for her fiery temper and conflict with her sister Namakaikahai, Pele wrought Hawaii into a paradise, making her home within the great calderas of the volcanoes that stand sentinel across the island chain.

To worship Pele is to grant one's devotion to a goddess of terrible power, one who can shape and render a grand, vibrant world into being at her slightest whim, and burn it to ashes just as quickly. But just as her worshippers are devoted to Pele, she devotes herself to them as a force of divine protection and care. She is a tireless defender of life and the people that dwell upon her islands, and any that seek to threaten them shall surely taste Pele's fire."
Hel,"Benevolent, Malicious","Both beautiful and terrible, the Goddess Hel is keeper of the dead, lays judgment on souls, and decides who is reborn. She is both sides of two extremes.As the daughter of Loki, the trickster God, Hel’s destiny, much like her brothers Fenrir and Jormungandr, was doomed to darkness from the start. Odin, the All-Father, uncovered prophecies that Hel and her siblings would be the source of great calamity resulting in Ragnarök, the battle that would end all things. In an effort to prevent this, he cast each of the three into different realms; not quite a prison, though far from freedom. For Hel, Odin gave her charge of the realm of the dead, specifically those that died of sickness and old age. For himself, Odin retained Valhalla for those that died in battle.At birth, Hel’s face was cast half in shadow, half in light; she was both living and dead, so took immediately and graciously to her new role, gifting Odin with the ravens Huginn and Muninn in appreciation. As the spirits of the kind-hearted, the sick, the elderly were brought to her, she cared for them, gave them comfort, yet those she deemed evil she mercilessly hurled into the frozen depths of Niflheim.Yet, despite Odin’s efforts, destiny cannot be averted. Hel’s conflicting struggle between benevolence and malice will force her to one extreme or the other. A time will come when Hel will fulfill her prophecy, though it is yet unknown if she will be a shadow of darkness or a force of light."
Nox,"Primal, Complex","So fragile is the line between sleep and death, the difference only waking with the dawn. In that darkness she reigns, as the sun sinks below the horizon, as stalkers hunt their prey, as shadows thicken to consume the light. She is primal in a way that even the mightiest of Gods must fear, for she is the Goddess of Night, Nox, and from her was born all the certainties of life.Friendship and Love, Sunsets and Dreams, these are the Gods of inspiration. Nox is mother to them all. So too is she the mother of misfortune: Doom and Blame, Deceit, Strife, Woe and Death. Nox must love and protect all her children equally, as any mother would. They are her calling and her curse; her greatest pride and deepest shame. It is for her children she has now come to war.Clothed not in black, but blackness, Nox is rarely seen. She glides between the light, just at the edge of vision. A specter. Even the God of Thunder is known to fear her, for Nox could steal his whispered breath and send him to a sleep eternal where dreams do not exist and no one ever wakes with the dawn."
Phaia,"Resourceful, Adventurous","Phaia is a mercenary, bounty hunter, and adventurer from the fantasy kingdom of Elbalm. When money is tight, Phaia is also a prostitute.

Despite her situation, she keeps her smile and even makes jokes about it."
The Morrigan,"Manipulative, cold","Fate is an unusual thing. An unseen force predicting every action of every being. Some deities can see it, recognizing the flow of the plan. There are none, save one, that claims mastery over it, that manipulates it with such cold intent, that steers it ever toward war and the red demise of heroes. In truth, she is many Goddesses, with many names and many forms. But there is only one title. The Morrigan

Anu, Macha, Badb. Individually, these three Goddesses were sisters, progenitors of sovereignty, war, and death. They were caretakers of their lush green Éire, champions for armored soldiers, guides for the deceased. It is unknown what bound them together. Some whispered curse, some lover's scorn. Some dark power or darker purposes. But now they are one.

She's been seen in many shapes. The lurid seductress, the wrinkled hag, the screaming crow, and worst of all, the washer in the river. For those who witness her cleaning their bloody armor prophesies a violent end.

Subtle and manipulative, there is no war The Morrigan did not incite. No dying breath she did not collect. Even this war, a war between Gods, must secretly be of her making. So, beware those that behold her, for The Morrigan controls your fate."
Chang'e,"melancholy, brave","Not always born in the crucible of creation, sometimes Gods ascend by tragic happenstance. Such is the tale of Chang’e, Goddess of the Moon.

Among the immortals that lived in the Heavens, Chang’e was the most elegant dancer, like a dove on windswept currents. She drew the affection of the hero archer, Hou Yi, and the two were soon married. Everything was perfect.

Yet, beneath the Heavens, all was not well. Ten suns, the ten children of the Jade Emperor, rose to scorch the earth and boil the seas. Brave Hou Yi, bow in hand, shot nine from the sky, sparing only one. Though the world was saved, the Jade Emperor was furious his children were killed. In punishment, Hou Yi and Chang’e were made mortal.

Chang’e grew melancholy and danced no more. To restore their status in the Heavens, Hou Yi found the Elixir of Immortality, but thieves came to steal it while he was hunting. Chang’e struggled to hide the Elixir, but, in the end, was forced to drink it. Too much for one person, the Elixir gave her immortality, but it also swept her into the sky.

Since then, Chang’e has lived on the moon, forbidden to see her husband, a Jade Rabbit her only companion. Yet, the Earth is once again in peril, and Chang’e finds herself upon the mortal surface. Perhaps, this is a second chance. If only she can save the world without angering the Jade Emperor, she can at last reunite with her husband."
Nu Wa,"Guardian, Responsible","When two warring Gods shattered the World Pillar, Heaven and Earth dangerously shifted, and Armageddon was unleashed. Firestorms, floods, and bloodthirsty monsters ravaged the land and stole the lives of more than can be counted. In ages past, Nu Wa, Guardian of Heaven and Earth, hand-crafted all people from clay. They were her creations, her children, her responsibility.

As the Earth shuddered and broke, and the skies turned black with ash, Nu Wa forged five mystic stones, one for each of the elemental forces of nature: Earth, Water, Fire, Wood, and Metal. With the power of these stones, she slew a gargantuan tortoise, severed its legs, and raced to the broken World Pillar. One leg she used to prop the Heavens aloft and with the elemental stones, she sealed it in place. Balance between Heaven and Earth was restored, but the world was never the same. Skies cleared, but the stars had shifted. Seas retreated, but rivers drained westward. Everything leaned, but the End was averted.

In the years that followed, Nu Wa and her brother, Fu Xi, took the throne of China. They ruled with wisdom and ushered in an age of recovery and prosperity, for which she is adored and worshiped to this day.

Yet, the skies grow dark once more and chaos threatens to engulf the land. Gods from all Pantheons have chosen Earth as a battleground, trading blows with the same thoughtless fervor that destroyed the World Pillar so long ago. Determined to prevent such calamity from repeating, Nu Wa has summoned the elemental stones once more. For she is the Guardian of Heaven and Earth; all mankind are her creations, her children, her responsibility."
Aphrodite,"Beauty-driven, insecure","There are too few words to describe the radiance, the magnificence, the inequitable glory of Aphrodite, Goddess of Beauty. So wondrous is she to behold that one look can inspire tears, desire, jealousy, and love. Yet, beneath her flawless exterior resides a heart burdened with insecurity.

Inattentive and hideous to look upon, her husband, Hephaestus, unknowingly leaves Aphrodite feeling lonely and worthless. She finds consolation in the arms of other men such as Ares, or validation by competing in any contest of beauty she encounters.

At a wedding attended by all the Gods, a golden apple appeared, inscribed with the words ""to the fairest."" Immediately Aphrodite, her mother Hera, and sister Athena quarreled over it. Zeus elected Paris, Prince of Troy, to choose a victor. In exchange for being named the fairest, Aphrodite offered any woman in the world as his wife, so Paris agreed. However, he chose Helen as his wife, and their love began the catastrophic Trojan War.

Now, a new war brews, but this one between Gods, not men. While the battlefield is no place for the fairest of all, Aphrodite recalls the destruction between the Greeks and Trojans. Perhaps, this time, her beauty can be used to stop a war instead of start one. Perhaps, this time, she will discover the beauty within."
Athena,"wisdom, honor","In war, there are two kinds of soldiers: those that fight for blood, and those that fight for honor. The first crave the clash of steel and smell of slaughter, the latter know the wisdom of justice, the kindness of mercy, and that life should never be taken wantonly. These different warriors seek different Gods. Ares, God of War revels in the bloodletting, but his sister, Athena, Goddess of Wisdom, is patron to those who fight with dignity, and only when there is no other alternative.

Favored daughter of Zeus, wise as ten thousand scholars, just as the scales themselves; Athena is a paragon of incorruptible virtue, and worshipped with righteous fervor. So revered is she that Athens, greatest city in all the world, is named for her, and regal temples adorn the countryside in her honor, each tended by loyal priestesses. To Athena, a life is a precious thing that need not be wasted in frivolous battle. Bloodthirsty Ares, on the other hand, is reviled by their father and chained by his ravenous subjects.

At the Siege of Troy, Ares disobeyed Zeus and joined with the battle, fighting for the mortal Trojans. Athena rose to stop him, indirectly championing the Greeks, but directly keeping the order of divine law. Their fierce battle clashed in unspeakable proportions, ending only when Ares limped from the battle field, cowed by his sister and rival. With Ares diminished, the tide of the war shifted and the heroes of the Greek Army toppled Troy.

In times of war, prayers are sent to both Gods. Ares, for bloodstained victory, Athena for honor, valor, and the wisdom to fight with dignity. Make no mistake, these are times of war, and Ares has already answered the call to arms. Athena, ever cautious with lives, goes to battle without eagerness, but solemn necessity, for the Goddess of Wisdom knows honor is for the living. The dead have no need of it."

In the past, he had a streak of cockiness, believing himself to be the better of Meikai's familiars, fit to wield the Sacred Sword.

Deeply begrudged that Tatsumiya was given the responsibility, Old would come to loathe her and Meikai, leading to him to betray the two. Upon encountering Tatsumiya again on the field of battle, Old attacked her with an intense rage for the slight upon his honor.

After being sealed with Mikotsuhime for long, Old no longer holds any affection for any — not for his former comrades, his sons, or for the man he previously called Master. The only thing that remains is his desire to avenge himself by harming Tatsumiya, for the scars and the humiliating defeat that she gave him, a grudge that has remained since before he was first sealed


In the past, he was one of Meikai's familiars, alongside Tatsumiya. One day, Meikai was handed the Sacred Sword — a sword immensely important to the Blue Sea Kingdom — by The Sea King, ruler of the kingdom. The Sea King tasked Meikai with a difficult conundrum; he would have to decide between the two of his familiars which was worthy of wielding the legendary blade. Having believed that he would reign superior and be chosen to hold the blade, Old became indignant upon the revelation that, instead of him, Tatsumiya would be chosen as wielder instead.

Engulfed with rage and jealousy, Old would end up defecting to Mikotsuhime's side. He would later end up battling Tatsumiya, who would go on to leave him covered in his signature scars. Along with Mikotsuhime and other denizens of the Sea of Death, Old was sealed away by Meikai's sacrifice."

Mai is very energetic and expressive with her thoughts and feelings and because of this, she is sometimes blunt and slightly too open. She is very sassy, yet very loyal in her friendship with Hana. When Mai becomes sad or negative, she often becomes quiet and stews on her feelings."
Honnouji Tsukasa,"cowardly, kind","Haruomi's classmate, they eventually become good friends. He's not smart, but he's good at sports. Even though he is good-looking, Tsukasa isn't popular with girls because of his cowardly and weak, ""hetare"" personality. Despite that fact, he loves girls and really wishes to be popular with them. Convinced that Haruomi has grasped his weakness, Tsukasa feels as though he is outclassed by him. Even so, he greatly adores Haruomi. His favourite phrase is ""I'm your best friend, riiiight?"" 

When Haruomi is down, Tsukasa shows his kind side when he tries to cheer him up. Very self-conscious about his height, he wears ""secret shoes"" to give himself a 10cm boost. He's also afraid of becoming bald, since his father is so. His behaviour is puppy-like, so he frequently (and jokingly) gets called ""Pochi"" and ""Shiro"" (common Japanese dog names) by his peers."
Media,"cheerful, persuasive","Media first appears in episode 9 as the The Professor's assistant, and enrolls in Momotsuki High to keep an eye on Becky. She possesses superhuman strength and is always cheerful. She resembles Ichijo in that she does the seemingly impossible, but she does this much less frequently than Ichijo. She and Behoimi have a past together that they vaguely allude to but never explain fully. Media is nearly always smiling and never ""opens"" her eyes, except for one instance in episode 9. Also, she is almost never seen without wearing her trademark maid outfit in the anime. In later episodes, she attempts to persuade Behoimi to take on her role as the ""healing magical girl"" once more, even in one episode putting a smaller version of her magic wand in her hand, trying to invoke a response, but Behoimi does not fall victim to her suggestions. Apparently, she and Behoimi once fought. Similar to Behoimi, her name is a reference to a moderate healing spell from an RPG series, Shin Megami Tensei."
Ikue Ogawa,"Playful, silly","A close friend of Himeji's, which makes her a member of the group by default. She is the cute, petite girl of the group who acts as young as she looks.

Lua,"resilient, courageous","Lua grew up on a colonized planet in the Amaar solar system, gaining most of her firearms experience hunting Quaar to defend her settlement. With her affinity for explosives and reputation as a crack shot, Lua quickly became the go-to hunter among her people. As the Quaar began to overrun surrounding settlements, growing in number and viciousness, Lua led several squads against them--usually returning victorious, but incurring heavy losses.

In one of her missions, Lua had lost the entirety of her squad while awaiting reinforcements. Her distress call was picked up by a nearby Reclamation ship, and its response came in the form of three Masters being dispatched to her position. Taejin, Maia, and Merope met with Lua to be briefed on the situation, and together, they purged several skittering caves, wiping out a large chunk of the Quaar in one go. Though they parted ways for a while after that, Lua remembered what it felt like to fight with people she could finally consider equals. After going back home to visit her mother, she decided to join the Reclamation fleet to take back Earth, and contacted the Dredgion. Imadath, recognizing her ability to use Sol, agreed to assign her as a Master."
V-Merang,"Curious, Brave","The daughter of two wealthy entrepreneurs who escaped on one of the first ships to take off from Earth, Era was named for their hope of starting a new chapter in human history. She and over 70,000 other voyagers were placed in cryostasis as their ship ventured out in search of a Synd-free world. Era was barely more than a toddler when she awoke to the horrible, skittering sound of something with too many legs. The ship crash-landed on the planet Sameta, where Era--now the only survivor--was taken in by a Sametan rescue party who came to investigate.

She grew up happy and healthy, believing she was no different from the other Sametan children, except for her lack of antlers. As she began to grow older and question why that was, her parents told her the truth of where she'd been found. They gave her a helmet made from an artifact they'd found on the ship with her, a V-shaped item that rested on her forehead to mimic the antlers she wanted so desperately. Now knowing the truth about her origins, she left Sameta to find out more about humans and where she came from, changing her name to V-Merang in honor of Sametan naming customs."
Arami,"Stubbornness, Adventurousness","Arami was unwittingly smuggled onto the Dredgion by Vonak for a client who has since disappeared. While she appears to be a human child, it is unknown whether or not she is technically human. DNA tests show odd abnormalities in her cells, but no direct matches can be found to any known species. Despite multiple attempts to remove her from the Dredgion and place her into the care of a family, she refused to leave. She exhibited immeasurable power and stubborness when anyone tried to make her do anything she didn't want to do.

Eventually, seeing that they were at an impass, Imadath told her that she could stay so long as she didn't use her power on the Dredgion, as her inexperience caused her to be a liability to the crew's safety. Arami agreed, and instead stowed away with Masters when they went out on missions to explore her powers. While she was reprimanded many times, it became clear that no one could keep her from sneaking onto away missions, and the Masters began to welcome her presense on their missions like a good luck charm. Arami seems to see this entire war as a game, completely unaware of any risk or danger as she gleefully charges into combat."

Irabu Ichirou,"eccentric, carefree","Dr. Irabu is the son of the founder of the Irabu General Hospital. Irabu is a psychiatrist with a care-free, eccentric, and childlike personality. He changes appearance throughout scenes. In his first form, he is slightly overweight wearing bright clothes under his labcoat with a large green bear head that can change expression to suit his.

Abriel Nei Debrusc Borl Paryun Lafiel,"strong-willed, impulsive","Ablïarsec néïc Dubreuscr Bœrh Parhynr Lamhirh (a.k.a., Viscountess Paryunu Abriel Nei Dobrusk Lafiel) is the main female protagonist in the anime Crest of the Stars, Banner of the Stars, and Banner of the Stars II, as well as all the novels written by Morioka Hiroyuki on which the shows were based. She is a strong-willed Abh princess (granddaughter of the Abh empress) who has a steely exterior, but ends up befriending Ghintec Linn (Jinto Lynn in the Martinh tongue). Like all Abh, she has bluish hued hair, and has a natural lifespan of over 200 years. Lamhirh also has lapis lazuli colored eyes. As an Ablïarsec, she has pointed ears, yet hers are markedly less so than other Ablïarsec. This is because half her genes (those not from her father) are from someone outside the Abriel clan and her father chose not to make any unnecessary alterations in her genes. She is deemed ""child of love"" (an Abh child with the genes of the parent, and the one the parent loves). Her full name can be roughly translated to Lamhirh (néïc Dubleuscr) Ablïarsec, Viscountess of Parhyn.

Despite being a princess, she rarely acts like one and hates being treated as one. One of the reasons she took a liking towards Ghintec is because when they first met, he neither recognized her as a princess nor treated her as one. Their relationship is so close that she freely allows him to use her real name of Lamhirh when addressing her, something that is very uncommon when addressing those of nobility or royalty.

She acts remarkably older than her age (at her introduction in Crest of the Stars, she is 16 years old) and can, in most cases, logically think her way out of most situations. However, her headstrong nature sometimes clouds her judgement and can lead her to become impulsive. An example of this is when she is reprimanded by Laicch for wishing to stay behind on the Gothlauth instead of continuing her mission of escorting Ghintec to the capital. She believes that she would have been of more use fighting with the crew rather than abandoning them. She is quickly shown how wrong her line of reasoning is and how much more disgraceful it would have been to abandon Ghintec and her mission. She is a remarkably good shot and although she sometimes doubts herself, she proves to be a worthy ship captain (deca-commander) in Banner of the Stars. She shows little emotion throughout Crest of the Stars, but as time goes by became very close friend with Ghintec through Banner of the Stars. This is especially true in later installments, where she more frequently questions how their friendship will last due to the doubt of Ghintec's lifespan.

She is one of the candidates for the Abh Imperial Throne and, as indicated by her full name, she is the Viscountess of Parhynh, the so-called ""Country, or Nation, of Roses."""

Lillianne von Phoenix,"calm, independent","Lilliane von Phoenix (リリアーヌ, Ririānu), usually known as Hime, is the main female protagonist of the series. She is the second princess of the Royal Family and is seventeen years old at the beginning of the series. She despises her own name and prefers being called ""Hime"" (姫, lit. Princess), which is the Japanese title for a lady of royal birth. It is a nickname given by her older sister, Sylvia. 

She would continue to use the name Hime until the last chapter of the manga, when she reveals to Hiro that her full name is Lilliane von Phoenix.Hime's appearance is very similar to everyone in the Royal Family: blonde hair, red eyes with slit pupils. Her hair is about waist-length and she wears a silver tiara. She almost always wears a black gothic dress, which has been her signature outfit since childhood. The gauntlets were added later.

Her dress also seems to be shorter at the beginning of the series. In the last chapter, her outfit changes completely, consisting of a light colored sweater-coat, white dress shirt, dress skirt, and rain boots. Fully matured, she now has 2 small spikes of hair just above her forehead. She also stops wearing her tiara.Unlike her siblings, Hime does not seem interested in taking the throne. She is relatively calm in most situations, although if caught by surprise, she can lose a bit of edge. As Sherwood stated, one of her best advantages is the ability to retain her composure. Hime mostly keeps a straight face in daily situations, but gets angry/shocked/sad when dire situations occur. She is noticeably more emotional in the manga than in the anime (probably due to a change in character design). In the early chapters of the manga she is shown to be quite arrogant and spoiled, at one instance thinking back about how many servants she used to have and complaining about having only Hiro (and Flandre) now. In one scene she is slightly sadistic by having Hiro play a ""game"": as the effect of her blood is running out, the dying Hiro must catch her drops of blood as she drips them from a balcony above him. Eventually she becomes quieter and better-mannered.

She has the traits of a ruler, a fact noticed by almost everyone who knows her (mostly Gilliam). She is one of the few who has a pure-blood vampire serving her with complete loyalty. She also shows great capability in negotiating with other monsters and creatures. Because of her characteristics, as the story goes on she becomes targeted for reasons other than the throne. For example, Death wanted to take her because she has a noble soul. As stated by Sherwood, she is very kind and unchanging, though this became a hindrance for her when it came to defeating their siblings. She was also said to be well-known among her brothers and Ladd the Moleman told Hiro that she is also popular among the residents of the kingdom. When confronted by her siblings, Hime will get slightly surprised or irritated.

When she had to retreive Hiro and step into the battle between Gilliam and Emile, Gilliam was initially reluctant to involve her. In Chapter 60 when he saw how she negotiated with the scout of the army of the Apocalypse, he stated that she unexpectedly exhibited the qualifications for a ruler and felt uneasy that his battle with her was inevitable. These characteristics makes her very worthy for the throne and a huge threat to her other siblings. Even their deceased brother, Emile, came back in flame form just to tell Hime that she must become the Ruler of Monsters. Though with this said, she still doesn't show much interest in the battle for the throne and entrusted the task and helped Sherwood to become the next ruler instead.

Hime is very independent, but as a Royalty she still needs servants to cook and clean for her. She is also not above destroying property to kill an enemy, such as burning down her own mansion to kill the Invisible Man, only to have her servants rebuild it (this has happened no less than five times during the course of the manga). She's also skilled in combat, can effectively use any weaponry at her disposal, such as a chainsaw, a defibrillator, a hammer, or various swords.

She usually sits around her mansion, reading a book or drinking tea and refers to Sawawa's food as the best; her favorite tea is Sawawa's Earl Grey. According to Riza, Hime does not eat much (like meat), which explains her slim outline.

Hime won't allow anyone to call her by her real name, Lillianne, nor does she like to be called ""Ojou-sama"" (which means ""my lady"" or ""master"" in Japanese, it explicitly means ""Master"" in the anime series). Hime and the rest of the Royal Family were hinted to be of German origin (or at least spoke German) as in chapter 41, she wrote a note that says ""entkomm"" to Hiro. ""Entkomm"" is the German word for ""escape"". Furthermore, the androids are all programmed in German."

Or at least, she's mostly Varisian—as might be apparent from her otherworldly grace, there's something not quite human in her ancestry. Though she doesn't have any hard facts, Seoni herself has picked up on some of this, and is constantly pushed to search deeper into the mysteries of her heritage by strange dreams that she doesn't understand.

More than just ornamentation, Seoni's runic tattoos play a large role in her personality. Coming from a people where tattoo magic maintains a strong following, hers are simultaneously a manifestation of her power and a tool to aid in her castings. The sheer number adorning her skin, as well as the similar patterns woven into her clothes, are a mark of status among her tribe, though many of the so-called ""civilized"" residents of Varisia look upon such body modification with distaste.

Despite being a consummate adventurer, Seoni is something of an enigma to her compatriots. Quietly neutral on most matters, bound by codes and mandates that she rarely feels compelled to explain, the sorceress keeps her emotions tightly bottled. Extremely detail oriented—what the more pugnacious members of her party call a ""control freak""—Seoni is a careful and meticulous planner, a schemer who frequently finds herself frustrated by the improvised plans of her more impulsive companions. Despite all of this, Seoni has stuck by her comrades through numerous tight spots, a fact that continues to amaze and confuse Valeros, who wonders loudly (although not altogether unappreciatively) about ""the witch and her schemes.""

Koromo Amae,"Charming, Distressed","Koromo Amae is a second year student at Ryuumonbuchi High School and the team's ace player. Koromo's ability as a player is famous, so much that she is considered one of the national-class monsters. She is the key player that brought an end to Kazekoshi Girls' High School's winning streak a year before the start of the current storyline and is considered one of the rare examples of national-level ""demons"" in the series' syndicate of high school players. She is feared by friend and foe alike; due to her actions and position, she can be considered the primary antagonist of the Prefectural Tournament Arc.

An over one thousand year old elven version of Koromo appears in the Yuuki miniseries, humorously alluding to her bizarrely literary manner of speech and ""magical"" abilities. She is right-handed.Koromo has long blonde hair and blue eyes. She wears a bunny ears headband (pink bow after the prefecturals), a white and red one piece dress, wristbands and thigh high stockings. Koromo has the appearance of a little girl, but contrary to this, she is actually the eldest member of Ryuumonbuchi's mahjong club. Her physical development is somewhat stunted, appearing much younger than she truly is.Koromo boasts an unusually literary manner of speech, resembling that of nineteenth century philosophers or writers, such as Edgar Allan Poe or even Mark Twain, despite Saki’s setting taking place decades in the future. On a few occasions, she has even completely made up words devoid of any meaning.

Koromo has three distinctive “sides” depending on her mood; the first being, In correspondence with her childish appearance, the fact that her mood can sometimes make complete U-turns from the traits as stated above, prompting her to act hyperactive, childish, and carefree at completely unrelated or random moments; it is implied several times throughout the series that is very easy to make Koromo happy, despite what her inner monologue may be at the time. It is worth noting that even during these states of happiness, she still has a tendency to be literary in speech and, sometimes, manner.

Her second side reveals a much darker, drearier part of her personality; oftentimes she will wander aimlessly in the town or place she’s in, lost in her own thoughts, feeling alone and depressed. She blames this on the loss of her parents years before the start of the current storyline, who raised her, believing that her only self-worth is through mahjong which she believes (in part because of her mother) is worthless anyway and she initially considers herself incapable of finding a person in the world who enjoys the game with her. It is highly likely that the years of reclusiveness and solitude she endured after moving in with her neglectful uncle triggered this chain of dejection, so much so that she had become bitter and untrustworthy of the humans of the world, until she found a friend in Saki Miyanaga.

Her third side is perhaps the most ferocious; whilst playing mahjong, she gives away her other moods which depending on the scenario can either be happy-go-lucky or reclusive and distant, and takes her turn being violent and disdainful, oftentimes making cruel, somewhat disturbing comments about her opponents; her behavior is directly influenced by the full moon, which she becomes more erratic and her personality more jagged under – it is unknown what exactly about the moon and mahjong prompts Koromo to act this way. In addition, Koromo does not consider herself human, despite her appearance saying otherwise; which begs the question if Koromo really is human and her words are just her exaggerating herself, or if she is something else.

Due to these reasons, it’s speculated that Koromo possibly has Bipolar disorder, as a result of her consistent moodswings. It appears that after befriending Saki and the others, these tendencies have quelled a bit, leaving her childish personality and a bit of her darker side.

She also dislikes being treated as a kid or referred to as a kid; this includes even not being the dealer in mahjong. This is because her name, Koromo, is similar to the word kodomo which means children; in Japanese mahjong the dealer is called 親 oya meaning parent, while the non-dealers are referred to as 子供 kodomo. Despite her hate of being referred to as a child, she acts very childishly."

Nagisa considers it a fatal blow and is horrified when Yukari shows up at work wearing the same thing she wore in the dream."
Tomoka Tenkubashi,"kind, domineering","Tomoka is a young girl who acts and speaks in a polite and refined way. She calls her fans ""piglets"" because “it’s cuter than calling them lost sheeps”, and she thinks of herself as the Virgin Mary.

To explain what Tomoka is really like can be quite a complicated task. At first glance, she looks like a refined young lady, but when she opens her mouth, what comes out is polite but insulting words. Coupled with the fact that Tomoka calls her fans “piglets” and talks about how happy they are to be dominated by her, it’s easy to assume that she's a sadistic girl. Which might not be entirely wrong, but that isn't entirely true either.

First of all, a sadistic person is someone who inflicts pain, psychically or mentally, on others for the sake of their own pleasure, but look at Tomoka's hobby: making her fans happy. There are many moments in the game that show that Tomoka really loves her fans and works hard to please them. That isn't something a sadistic person would do. So one could say that the way she treats her fans is just a way she shows her love. It might be strange and twisted, but it's still love nonetheless because she really believes that they're happy to be dominated by her.

Along with the fact that she's always kind to her fellow idols and helps them whenever she can, it shows that she's not just a sadistic girl who looks down on others, but really what she claims herself to be: a holy mother who gives love and hope to the lost and the pitied. It’s just that she gives them love by becoming someone who they can worship and serve. In return, she’ll give them unconditional love, like the Virgin Mary.

In short, Tomoka is a kind girl who loves all people equally like a holy mother, but also she demands worship and total loyalty from all. She would like nothing more than a world where everyone can get along happily with each other, but she also believes that the only way the world can become such a happy place is by her domination over everyone as the holy mother.

Her image song “Maria Trap” also shows what she is really like (though this song is quite hard to interpret). The song is about the two sides of “Maria”: the kind and lovely “Maria” and the twisted and dominatrix “Maria”, and the madness that comes from conflicting two sides.

Her personality might come from the fact that she is loved by everyone she met since her childhood and it's hinted in the game that she might be Christian (her family owns a chapel, and she says things like “the lost sheep”, “the voice that cried out for (her) salvation”, etc) although it might or might not have influenced her ideals. Despite her personality, Tomoka still has a more normal and childish side, which she sometimes show to the Producer if they become close."
Serika Hakozaki,"Innocent, Friendly","Serika is a good girl. Well, there aren't any characters in the series that are really ""evil"" or bad just to be bad, save for Kuroi and CG's Reina, but Serika probably couldn't be mean even if she wanted to. She leads a sheltered life and doesn't know what a family restaurant is, that you can drink juice from a can (she wonders where the glass to pour it into was), how to cook, or why men like women with bigger chests. Her parents are very protective and her father worries about her participating in idol activities, but he's happy that she has so much fun singing and dancing. It's safe to say that she comes from a rich family, given her sheltered upbringing, hobbies, interests, and princess-like outlook. However, Serika is aware that she doesn't know much about the world and asks the Producer to teach her lots of things. Overall, she has a very friendly, positive demeanor."
Reika Kitakami,"free-spirited, childish","Her personality can only described as free-spirited and childish. She often comes up with weird ideas like giving the Producer a dried fish flavoured chocolate on Valentine's Day, because it's also Dried Fish Day in Japan. She praises the Producer in ways that are hard to take as compliments. For example, she called the Producer a normal person who looks a bit unreliable, but she truly meant it as compliment, since it makes her feel more comfortable around him. She often takes actions that surprise others, such as choosing a plastic trumpet as a Christmas gift for her parents, mistaking a deer for a bird, or using a dishwashing gel to clean the bathroom. Nevertheless, she always means well. In short, she's a kind-hearted person who loves to see people smile, but possesses a unique way of viewing the world that can be hard for others to understand."
Elena Shimabara,"energetic, friendly","Elena is a half Japanese-Brazilian girl who lived in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil before moving to Japan at the age of 6. This has not only allowed her to speak a little bit of Brazilian-Portuguese, but also to speak a bit of Japanese, too. Although she lived in Brazil for only 6 years, Elena has a great love for football and carnivals. She also wants to perform samba, regardless of place and time.

Elena is very energetic and friendly, but she's not good with formalities. She's also kindhearted and cares for her friends, especially Kotoha and Megumi. Part of the reason why she always acts energetic is because she wants to make her friends smile."
Rio Momose,"confident, caring","The second oldest among the MILLION STARS, Rio is a woman with a sexy body and she knows it. While she likes to use it as her weapon, the results are not as good as she hopes. According to her own words, Rio is never popular among the boys and she doesn't know why. Although that is most likely because, while she has a very attractive body, Rio doesn't know how to charm men at all, and thus, her tactics are always too straightforward and drive men away instead. Although she has a carefree personality, like most adult idols, Rio can often be seen taking care of the younger idols."
Nao Yokoyama,"Cheerful, Energetic","A cheerful and energetic girl from Osaka who speaks in Kansai dialect, Nao is what is considered to be a stereotypical Osakan person; like always keeping some candy for herself; though she not good with tsukomi in a boke & tsukomi routine. Nao is not a very bright girl, preferring to take action instead of thinking things over, and also has great confidence in her own stamina. She is very forgetful, often forgetting that she has a lesson, and sometimes forgets even what she just said a few minutes ago.

Nao is also a harapeko (a character who can eat a lot and eats often, like Takane), evident by the fact that she wears a shirt that has harapeko written on it and a few of her cards depict her eating something, and she also often complains that she's hungry. Nao's close friends include Takane Shijou, Arisa Matsuda, and Minako Satake. Despite this, Nao is often irritated with Arisa's behavior of collecting other idols' data. As proven in a Drama CD, where Arisa revealed that she has a collection of Nao's photos."
Shiho Kitazawa,"Independent, Caring","The lone wolf of the MILLION STARS, Shiho is in many ways similar to Shizuka, from their cold and stoic looks, their harsh treatment towards the Producer, and even down to their family problems.

Yet, the two could be said to be polar opposites; since Shiho actually wants to work alone or at least doesn’t want to rely on others if she can help it. Early on, she sees the other girls as nothing more than rivals and thinks their making friends as foolish, often getting annoyed by silly idols like Akane and attempts to befriend her. However, she begins to defrost and view the other members of 765 Pro as family after they treat her kindly. Despite clashing with Kana in the movie, the two are now very close.

Similar to Shizuka, Shiho's personality is most likely caused by family problems, but in her case it came from a lack of a fatherly presence since early childhood (While Shizuka's comes from having a protective and overly strict one). It’s unclear what happened to her father, but his absence forced Shiho to help her busy mother take care of her little brother, which made her used to doing things by herself. However, her mother isn't entirely absent; during the winter Caravan event, Shiho reveals that her mother has been sending her care packages full of things like scarves and medicine. It's more likely that her mom is just very busy.

Even though she acts like that, she does have a sweet side, although she mostly shows it to her little brother. If the Producer manages to gain her trust, she’ll show a little of it to him too. A look at her hobby and her favorite thing suggests that she is still a child at heart. Her lack of a father figure present in her life made Shiho yearn for a substitute, which is reflected in her comment that she wants the Producer to act in a more father-like way like President Takagi."

The weapon seems to be using the same receiver group as Taurus' MT9 G2 9mm SMG, the upper receiver is made aluminum alloy and the lower is made of polymer material with an integrated magwell grip.

ART556 have a forward charging handle and ejection port can be changed to access from both side of the receiver, the charge/ejection mechanism is potentially ambidextrous, just like the fire selector. The fire selector can enable semi-automatic, 3-round burst, fully automatic and function as a safety. The weapon stock can be folded and can be extended.

Shorter rails can be found on the side and bottom of the barrel for other combat accessories. The weapon is likely fed with STANAG issue magazines, it is to be noted that the magazine well looks big enough to potentially accept 7.62x51mm NATO/.308 Winchester cartridge magazines, hinting that the weapon could potentially be modified to fire the 7.62mm calibre.

Le Pen (father),"Controversial, Polarizing","Jean-Marie Le Pen (French pronunciation: ​[ʒɑ̃ ma.ʁi lə.pɛn]; born 20 June 1928) is a French politician who has served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from France since 2004, previously between 1984 and 2003. He served as Honorary President of the National Front from 2011 to 2018 and President of the National Front from 1972 to 2011.

Born and raised as a Roman Catholic in La Trinité-sur-Mer, Le Pen first attended the Jesuit high school François Xavier in Vannes then Dupuy-de-Lôme in Lorient. After being dismissed from it in April for indiscipline, he briefly attended the high school Jules-Simon in Vannes before being dismissed again for indiscipline. Le Pen finally graduated from Claude-Debussy high school in Saint-Germain-en-Laye in 1947. He then entered the faculty of law in Paris and graduated from it in 1949. After his time in the military, he studied political science and law at Panthéon-Assas University. His graduate thesis, submitted in 1971 by him and Jean-Loup Vincent, was titled Le courant anarchiste en France depuis 1945 or ""The anarchist movement in France since 1945"".

Le Pen focuses on issues related to immigration to France, the European Union, traditional culture and values, law and order and France's high rate of unemployment. His progression in the 1980s is known as the ""lepénisation of spirits"" due to its noticeable effect on mainstream political opinion. His controversial speeches and his integration into public life have made him a figure who polarizes opinion, considered as the ""Devil of the Republic"" among his opponents or as the ""last samurai in politics"" among his supporters.

His longevity in politics and his five attempts to become President of France have made him a major figure in French political life. His progress to the second round in the 2002 presidential election left its mark on French public life and the ""21st of April"" is now a frequently used expression in France.

He is currently a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) and served as the Honorary President of the National Front from January 2011 to March 2018. He was expelled from the party by his daughter Marine Le Pen in 2015, after new controversial statements."

Now in perfect health, Sakura is the Tomobiki High school nurse and a Shinto priestess or miko.

Discordia,"mischievous, cunning","It is said Rome wasn't built in a day. Whether the sweeping arches of the Colosseum, the long stretch of the aqueducts, or the power the Servian Wall, none can truly claim they were the origin that “built” Rome. For as mighty as she has become, Rome might have never been were it not for the mischief of the Goddess Discordia.

Once known among the Greeks as Eris, the maligned Goddess of Strife, Discordia craved to unleash her full potential, to unravel the foundations of the mortals and deities that hated her. She found that opportunity through the vanity of others.

Conjuring a golden apple, Eris cast it forth. Upon it read the words ‘for the fairest.’ A phrase that would set Athena, Hera, and Aphrodite against one another. A phrase that would cause Paris to kidnap Menelaus' wife, Helen. A phrase that would ignite the Trojan War.

As chaos swirled, as cities crumbled, as heroes both Greek and Trojan fell to each other's blades and Gods grew to loathe one another, no one seemed to wonder from whence the golden apple came. It was masterful! Eventually, the Trojan War reached its peak, and Eris attached herself to the mortal Aeneus. She guided him safely from Troy, across the sea and wilderness, to the place where a new nation would be built. Here, Aeneus founded Rome.

Free of the judgement she wore under the Greeks, bereft of the belittling glares of the other Gods, Eris was remade as Discordia. A Roman Goddess of importance and prominence. Indeed, Rome was not built in a day. It was the culmination of a plan for one Goddess to reinvent herself as more than she ever was.

Merope,"Lacking emotion, rigid","The second-to-last of the Pleiades Series built by an Earth native known as Stein, Merope is technically classified as an “Android Rescue Bot.” While not Masters in the traditional sense, she and her sisters were specifically built to be powerful enough to stand with them in combat. The Pleiades Series of androids are programmed to protect Masters at all costs, and are unable to act without direct orders. As they are given only basic AI and personality function, Merope often makes people uncomfortable with her lack of emotion, inability to understand humor, and direct, formal way of speaking.

Despite her lack of human characteristics, she does occasionally exhibit curiosity about mortal functions, such as eating and drinking. Merope often sees herself as strange middleground between Synd and humans. She called herself the Fallen Star, and believes she is incomplete. She yearns, despite her rigid programming, to find a place amongst existence where she will be recognized at equal standing. Perhaps this is why she has outfitted herself with so many armaments, as to match any Master on the battlefield."
Lilu,"Determined, grief-stricken","Lilu grew up on Nashrune, one of the fragments of a shattered world. The denizens live in a tribal society among the ruins of a former, forgotten civilization. Women within the clans occasionally manifest clairvoyant abilities, and both Lilu and her sister Mirel were recognized as seers. Mirel was especially powerful, and had been chosen by a spirit hawk. As such, when the clan's sacred Titan statue collapsed (under mysterious circumstances) and Nashrune became wracked with disasters, Mirel was blamed.

The clan called for her sacrifice to appease the Titans, and despite Lilu's protests, Mirel went dutifully to the altar. After her death, the disasters ceased--but Lilu sensed something was amiss. Grief-stricken and betrayed, she uncovered signs that outsiders had been present on Nashrune. Her sister's spirit hawk, Haru, came to her so that she could better serve her clan, but Lilu had other ideas. She caught an Amaari ship off-world in the hopes that she could find out who was truly responsible for her sister's death."
Lorraine,"determined, bitter","Once a promising journalist, Lorraine lost her job and her reputation following a story she broke about an Amaari investment scam that had targeted the Reclamation Fleet. Furious and bitter that politics had obscured the truth, Lorraine was ready to give up on her career. Still, photography was her passion, and she'd been on her own since her father's mysterious death a few years earlier.

She began using her skill as a journalist to snap pictures of the mysterious Masters, becoming something of a paparazzi. When searching through her father's belongings one day, she found an old camera--a camera she recognized as an artifact, thanks to her association with the Dredgion. Though she has no real combat training, the power of the camera and her own wits have made her a Master in her own right."
Eirna,"powerful, responsible","The denizens of planet Sapphirus share a hive-mind, each kingdom's consciousness linked with a Queen. Though Eirna was born into the Queen caste and was considered the most powerful of all her sisters, she also marked the beginning of a blight on their people. There had only ever been a small number of Queens, – seven, to be exact. Eirna was a Queen born out of the cycle, an eighth Queen, and her life brought about a strain on the collected network the Queens were linked to their people through. With Eirna placing extra weight on their collective Hivemind, their links began to deteriorate. Though revered, as was her birthright, she was seen as a curse by some.

When the Amaari requested a representative be sent to the Dredgion, Eirna was the unanimous vote. Her distance from the planet lessened the load, and the Fractal she was given allowed her to focus only her kingdom's thoughts into a separate Hive through her. So long as she remained far away from Sapphirus, they could halt the fraying connections. It fell upon her to find a way to undo the strain she had imposed without leaving her kingdom stranded and leaderless. Though anxious about leaving her homeworld, she is relieved to be among people who are, in some ways, more like her than any of her sisters. Perhaps, with Atlas under her command, she could repair her damaged Hive."

While the MC's default name is Liz Hart, she can be renamed by the player.Liz is an orphaned girl who lives alone in a small village in the mountains called Reitz. As a child, Liz lost both parents to an epidemic that swept through her village. Consequently she was raised communally by other villagers, and views them all as an extended family.

Liz manifested magical abilities unexpectedly at the age of six, gaining the ability to cast spells as well as a special ability to speak to animals. In the village, she used her abilities to act as a sort of magical veterinarian, speaking to animals to figure out their problems before casting the appropriate healing spells on them. The villagers viewed her as a dependable and reliable wizardess, but in reality, her magic tended to go haywire whenever animals are not involved.

Liz's dream since childhood had been to attend Gedonelune Royal Magic Academy, and she sent applications there for several years. She idolized the great wizard Serge Durandal, who was said to be a great tamer of magical creatures, and hoped to follow in his footsteps.

At the start of the game, she finally receives what appears to be an Acceptance Letter to the school, and quickly departs to fulfill her dream.Liz is a kind-hearted, loyal, and somewhat naïve girl.

Ava Ire,"Brave, Kind","Ava Ire is a 15 year old girl and the protagonist of the story, currently pacted with the demon Wrathia Bellarmina. She speaks with dark red text and an orange speech bubble. Her first appearance is on page 0001.

The name ""Ava"" can have the meaning bird, desired, and life, all of which seem to relate to Ava's aspirations for herself as shown when making the pact. Michelle Czajkowski has also stated that she liked the name Ava ""...because it sounded vaguely like Alice and was hoping to give the feel of a standard young heroine."" Her last name ""Ire"" means ""intense anger or wrath"" , which is another association with her demon. Ava Ire also has a resemblance to ""Lava Fire"", but without the first letters.
Ava has a lot of difficulty associating herself with those around her. This mainly has to do with Wrathia scaring away everyone that ever cared about her or everyone she ever cared about. She has a very hard time in crowded areas and tight spaces as well. Despite her social anxiety, however, she shows bravery when doing things she feels passionate about, such as going after Odin after he abducted Maggie during her unconscious state, as well as threatening Wrathia for tricking her.

While Ava is a generally kind character, her kindness is not something that should be taken lightly. Ava can be quite harsh to those who have wronged her or hurt her in the past, including Wrathia and Odin. Even in her rage, however, she can sometimes catch herself in her words when she hurts someone else's feelings, often later claiming she was 'just mad'. Wrathia is an exception, though, as Ava hasn't seemed to feel any remorse for insults towards Wrathia, rather understandably so.

She also enjoys daydreaming, stargazing, rainy days, and sleeping. Her favourite animals are rabbits and she is quite fond of classical music. Her favorite movie genre is Fantasy and she also enjoys reading scary stories.

Ava's associated shape is a circle, representing her ability to roll with the punches and malleability. The circle is also interpreted as a closed shape, similar to how Ava is closed off from others.
Curiositys:
Ava's surname, Ire, means anger[4]. It may also be a reference to the French word ire, which means wrath.
Ava's limbo lenses were coated with space dust by Wrathia to condition her eyes to see the dead. The Limbo Lenses therefore only work with Ava.
Michelle Czajkowski has said that if Ava were to wear a Halloween costume it would be a rabbit. *Rabbits are her favorite animal.
Out of all the hosts so far, Ava is confirmed to be the second worst dancer, with Odin being the first.
It has been stated by the author that Ava enjoys singing and is quite good at it. If she were to have a canon singing voice, it would probably sound something like Ingrid Michaelson's.

Leila,"dominant, competitive","Leila is a princess, she is a total nympho that loves to have a male companion, Yuusuke, that’s totally submissed to her but in the end the so called “sex slave” ends taking control over the situation but he pays it by receiving some punishment from his princess.
She is totally opposite of her sister Tamaki whom she rivals in almost everything."

Misaya Ouji,"Ambitious, Authoritative","A popular senior at the Reien Girl's Academy. A talented girl who acted as the chairwoman of the student committee until the previous year. She is an impeccable mistress, and as Azaka once said, she is more of an intimidating empress rather than a cute princess."
Erika Akanishi,"Energetic, Confident","Erika is a wanna-be comedian who likes to laugh and make others laugh. Usually energetic and peppy, Erika has a strong sense of self-confidence. She's quirky and seems to live in a comedy routine, but she's actually a very responsible idol who takes her work seriously. Erika tends to emphasize the last word she says and her dialogue even has them written in Romaji rather than Hiragana, for example O-MA-KA-SE. She also adds a star “☆” to most of her sentences.

Her notable physical features include her hair (always styled into two braids), her large bust, and the flower pin that she wears in almost every non idolized card."
Yao Fueifuei,"caring, enthusiastic","Fueifuei is an immigrant from Hong Kong and is the daughter of a family that owns a Chinese restaurant. She embodies Japanese stereotypes of Chinese people, as she knows Kung Fu, she incorporates Wuxia into her costumes, and she wears a Qipao. Fueifuei speaks with a strong accent in the original Japanese release of the game.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Fueifuei’s love for cooking is often brought up. She makes lunch and other snacks for the other idols when at the office, and says that cooking is about passion and heart. When the Producer invites her to lunch at a fancy restaurant, she takes particular care of her appearance. Fueifuei tried to perform a tea ceremony while at work and did a rather bad job at it, but despite this she believes it was an excellent first attempt. While scattering beans at an event, she was attacked and engulfed by a swarm of hungry pigeons. She enjoys school uniforms and is eager to try on her fellow idols’."

Yuriko Ohnishi,"Passionate, Inactive","Yuriko is a passionate consumer of manga and anime, especially fancying one genre in particular: yaoi. She is a stereotypical and self-proclaimed fujoshi or ""rotten girl"", to the point that her first card's skill is named ""Fujoshi Talk"". She has been known to drool at some of her manga. While early cards depicted her as nothing much to look at, she gets consequently prettier with each card, and in her S Rare+ she looks stunning compared to her first Rare+.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Yuriko is a bright but rather inactive girl. She proves to be extremely bad at sports, particulcarly jump rope, as she can’t even make a single jump. Despite this, she shows amazing running stamina during her runs to collect doujinshi, carrying a weight of over two kilograms between thousands of people. She likes frilly clothes and fluffy things like feather dusters. She was accidentally responsible for Yuu Ohta using Akky as a cleaning duster."
Saori Okuyama,"Reserved, Outgoing","Saori is a girl from Akita who becomes an idol looking to change her geeky image. She introduces herself to the Producer by saying she'll probably screw up and cause trouble for him. She also has a unique reference, which she used ""wadasu"" (わだす), a Touhoku dialect which basically means ""I"", to refer herself. Her speech pattern seems to also lean towards her home dialect more.

Initially sporting a braid, huge light brown glasses, unkempt eye brows, and freckled face, she was also the first girl in the Cute category to wear glasses. However once she trains as an idol, she sports a huge change. Saori has her eye brows refined, her hair is taken down, and she clearly has a cleaner face. She will also remove her glasses, making her almost entirely a different person than before. Her glasses in her idol form are used as a necklace accessory, as seen in the game. She also normally wears a pink bear hairclip.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Saori is a reserved but trying to be more outgoing idol. Well known for her acting skills, she seems to have gained much of her experience from performing in her hometown. She found a friend in Fuka Asano, as the two believe it to be difficult to gain courage from new hairstyles or outfits. When she returns to visit her hometown from work, she is astounded to find that the entire community supports her as an idol and that her face is plastered all over town as a local celebrity. Saori is thoroughly embarrassed when Ayuna Hamakawa makes very physical advances to the Producer, although she didn’t know Ayuna was practicing for an upcoming role. Her role in a movie as a zombie girl was based off of a previous imitation she did of an angry grandpa, and she was impressed by Kurumi Ohnuma’s ability to wrapped into a jump rope by accident."
Miyuki Yanase,"Cheerful, Enthusiastic","Miyuki is a passionate lover of teddy bears and other stuffed toys. She's always either carrying a teddy bear or wearing her bear necklace. She wears it in all cards except her Halloween and Doll Festival rares.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Miyuki is a bright and excitable young girl. She loves plushies and soft, similar things such as mascot costumes. She is usually depicted as searching for her friends or the Producer, and her family has sent her to work with a crab before. She was notably terrified by Syoko Hoshi on Halloween, and she seems to like Nina Ichihara’s sleeping face."
Hajime Fujiwara,"Caring, Protective","Hajime is the inheritor to a lineage of renowned ceramic and porcelain craftsmen. She is depicted as a shop keeper and pottery master, to the point that her original Normal card featured her in the traditional outfit that Japanese potters wore. She is also usually shown with flowers in her hair while performing as an idol. Her initial set of cards featured her with a Camellia. Hajime’s S Rare+ card features an impossibly large Sakura blossom.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, it is revealed she only wears a T-shirt when at home and later admits that she isn’t entirely confident in her sense of style. She likes the flower viewing season, and is rather protective of the younger idols and their innocence. Hajime also enjoys fishing, and is one of the few idols who is willing to bait her rod with worms. She loves the view from outside elevators and considers them to be very romantic, stating that she used to admire the urban landscape outside. Upon hearing the Producer’s reasoning for them being used as crime prevention, she made a pout face for him ruining the mood."
Honoka Ayase,"dedicated, serious","Honoka is a ballerina who takes her craft very seriously and aims to be a Prima Ballerina. As she studies ballet, Honoka holds herself to (sometimes unfairly) high standards and devotes herself entirely to dance. She has somewhat of a rigid personality and starts off fairly disdainful of what she considers the less cultured world of idols. However, as she grows as an idol, she begins to break out of her shell and can't help but have fun when she gets into it, and newer cards show her having a more easygoing personality. She takes her work very seriously and often refuses to give something up until she’s mastered it. Additionally, she's still a skilled ballerina after becoming an idol, and it's said she can do stretches anywhere.

It's revealed in Starlight Stage that she became an idol when the Producer reached out to her after a dance practice. Honoka had been having second thoughts about her training, saying that although she was still performing perfectly without mistakes, she simply wasn't having fun anymore. Although she was apprehensive at first, she took his offer and became an idol.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Honoka is depicted as being dedicated and friendly to some of her idol friends, even helping Reina Koseki to fix her bazooka. However, she is shown as being extremely serious and concentrated during lessons and during acting practice.

She is initially friends with Shinobu Kudo, who challenges her to get a stuffed animal from a crane game. She eventually masters this ability and gains enough plushies to give to Shinobu, as well as keep her own ugly cat doll named Pinyakorata. She then meets Yuzu Kitami and Azuki Momoi on their day off, and proves once again how serious she is about lessons. When she meets up with Shinobu and Yuzu together, the trio sets out to knit. When a bored Yuzu stabs Pinyakorata, Honoka snatches him away from her torture. Since then, the four girls were usually shown together with Pinyakorata as their major theme. When going to the amusement park, Honoka’s interest in her green cat plushie carried over to a matching hat set, and the quartet decided to get Pinyakorata hats."
Tomo Fujii,"Obsessive, Intuitive","Obsessed with fortune-telling, Tomo becomes an idol as part of her journey to improve her luck. She generally has bad luck and relied on fortunes, especially when hers said that her life would reach a turning point upon becoming an idol. Tomo always makes sure her outfit and accessories match the ones her fortune says, and is often shown to be either reading her hand lines, putting her finger to her temple or posing in a common psychic stance.

Interestingly, Tomo and her fortunes can be interpreted in two different ways by players. Either she's just another Japanese girl obsessed with useless fortunes, or that she really is a very sharp fortune-teller.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Tomo’s fortune telling skills are put on display. She follows her horoscope and fortunes religiously, and relates advice to other idols under the guise of fortunes. The fortunes she relays to other idols seem to always come true in some form or fashion. Tomo will sometimes try to go places to “refresh” her luck, but it has sometimes gotten her into trouble. She has found friends in Umi Sugisaka and Setsuna Imura, who practically act like a mother and sister to Tomo respectively. Umi taught Tomo how to sew, which allowed Tomo to create her own lucky charm: a bluebird of happiness. Its shoddy craftsmanship and ominous feeling are notable to other idols."
Toko Hattori,"determined, grateful","Toko is unique among other idols in that she has already debuted once in the distant past. However, it went poorly, or she gave up on it. By the time she's ready to make her debut again, she has all but entirely given up on her dream. But once Toko is selected as an idol, she absolutely refuses to give up a second time, and is incredibly driven and grateful to the producer for giving her a chance.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Toko debuts at the same time as Aiko Takamori. As such, she is a victim of Aiko’s “time warping” abilities. She is also caught in a dogpile with Kana Imai, Kotoka Saionji and Miu Yaguchi when the trio’s playing gets out of hand."
Shiori Sena,"whimsical, nostalgic","Shiori is an idol who is fond of seashores and the scent of ocean brine. She always is wearing a sun hat, even when performing on stage. A singular card illustration has her without it on, but she's still carrying the sun hat in her hands. The only time she’s seen without on is at her Sports Event SR. Shiori loves mermaids, and sometimes uses it as a stage gimmick.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Shiori says that she loves the sea because it reminds her of her hometown. She thinks the ocean is beautiful, and feels calm by looking at fish and seashells. Shiori would like Clarice to be her witness when she is married and have Tamami Wakiyama as the train bearer. She also believes Kurumi Ohnuma’s ability to get wrapped up in jump ropes is practically a magic trick."
Ai Togo,"affectionate, confident","Ai is an attractive and mature saxophone player. While she never makes actual flirtations, she makes it very clear she's very interested in Producer. She also calls the Producer ""-kun"", as if he was a child or someone her own age she was very close with, and is very forward with him and others. Much like Makoto Kikuchi, she is very popular with female fans due to her boyish looks, and appears to even have her own gaggle of admirers in Starlight Stage.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Ai is assigned the role of head maid when working a café job with Shiho Makihara, Koume Shirasaka, and Frederica Miyamoto. She is mistaken for a boy by a drunk Sanae Katagiri, and takes care of her fellow idols when they worry about getting sunburnt before their live tour in Bali. Kaoru Ryuzaki sees her as an older sister and is the inspiration for the present Ai decided to give the Producer. Ai also enjoys going for a drive with the Producer, and is eager for him to lead her down the road to success."
Mutsumi Ujiie,"Adventurous, Eager","Mutsumi is a soft-spoken girl who wants to live a true adventure. She is always eager to discover the excitements of life that she has read about in her books and seen in her movies. Some of her more notable reads and movies include Don Quixote and Indiana Jones. While initially rather aloof, Mutsumi gradually lets herself be a bit wilder after she obtains her first Plus form. When in idol form, she switches her side braid for loose hair with curls.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Mutsumi tends to go into her adventures at full speed. While in Spain, she borrows Eve Santaclaus’s reindeer, Blitzen, and rides him away while calling him Rocinante. Kai Nishijima takes her to a water park where she enjoys being splashed by dolphins. She believes it is very important for idols to challenge themselves and she appears to be knowledgeable in the subjects of Japan’s history."
Kaoru Ryuzaki,"Innocent, Caring","In Starlight Stage, she met the Producer in the park and cheered him up as he picked up some documents that he had dropped. She revealed that she participated in some children's' television shows and interviews with her mother. When the Producer scouted her, she was hesitant at first as she didn't know anything about idols. But, when the Producer told her that it consisted of cheering people up, Kaoru happily agreed and asked the producer to become her teacher.

In the tie-in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Kaoru Ryuzaki is shown to be good friends and schoolmates with Mai Fukuyama and Chika Yokoyama. She holds her time with Producer (who she calls Sensei) very close to her and has even come back to school after she walked nearly all the way home just so the Producer could pick her up. Kaoru is the fourth member to join the “Little Marching Band Girls” unit, where she plays the drums. When she is invited to be the police commissioner for a day, she tries to arrest Ai Togo but finds that it’s better to follow the rules and have to a reason to arrest people. She was also the inspiration for Ai’s present to the Producer.

Kaoru is very innocent and is well protected from danger by older idols. She is not a very good cook but has fun trying her best. Her scary story for the group talk battle was about some boys in her class who brought a praying mantis into her classroom while it was laying eggs."
Naho Ebihara,"laid back, humorous","Naho is a laid back and calm girl whose body has been compared to that of a succubus. Official artwork puts a lot of overt focus on her breasts, despite not being the largest of all idols. That said, she herself makes many innuendos about her bust.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Naho considers her body to be her biggest selling point. She is often the victim of Atsumi Munakata’s habits but has found that she can distract the younger girl from groping her via her homemade buns, milking cows, and making sausage. She is quick to believe that Haruna Kamijo would try to put glasses on a cat."
Mahiro Kitagawa,"Energetic, Supportive","Mahiro is an energetic high school student who loves running. Despite loving running, she has very little stamina when she becomes an idol. She gets more as she progresses with idol work. She tends to eat a lot, and she seems to be partial to pudding.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Mahiro is an active girl who tends to think through her stomach. She likes German sausage and is reverent of Ritsuko Akizuki. She is very observant, having noticed the difference in Chiaki Kurokawa’s clothes and intentions towards the Producer. Mahiro is also shown to be very supportive of her fellow idols, as she jumps into Takumi Mukai’s crazy introduction for a Hinamatsuri event and cheers on Yuuki Otokura when she tries to eat carrots."
Itsuki Manabe,"Energetic, Kind","Itsuki is a woman whose natural talent and love for dancing led to becoming an idol. Saying she loves to dance is a tremendous understatement, and she can usually be found with Yoko Saito, who also likes exercising.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Itsuki is amazing at athletics. Overflowing with energy, she finds it impossible to sit still for even five minutes. She trains with Chiaki Kurokawa and runs marathons with her friend Yoko Saito. Itsuki also seems to enjoy partaking in Kung Fu and free running. She is good at rifle carnival games and proves to be kind when she gives her “bear ear headband” to Fuka Asano."
Kiyomi Saejima,"Strict, Authoritative","Kiyomi is a girl who feels the need to maintain strict social order and cleanliness among her peers. She intends to eventually become the Prime Minster of Japan and hopes her idol fame will help invoke a landslide election when she runs for political office. She will always appoint or nominate herself as the leader of a group, and believes herself to be a reasonable authority figure. Kiyomi proudly wears her red armbands (signifying leadership) on everything, although she occasionally swaps it out for a yellow sash. She wears glasses in street clothes, but wears contacts onstage.

Kiyomi’s yearn to win elections makes her very serious when taking part in one, and she will often go all out in order to win one. She would like to be her school’s Student Council President and establish it as an absurdly powerful entity. Kiyomi dislikes are people who don’t obey the rules and dirt. Because of this, she has gained many rivals with other idols who are considered to be delinquents. Her hate of dirt also sent her spring cleaning at the Producer’s apartment.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Kiyomi is introduced by Hasumi Nagatomi. She takes rules extremely seriously, and as a very no nonsense attitude. While she cares much about being an idol, she equally cares about her studies and self discipline. She gives out a red card to Yuko Hori for attempting and failing to use her psychic powers at an onsen, and to Chinami Komuro as well when she tells of her delinquent status in high school. She formed a band with Riina Tada, Seika Suzumiya and Layla.

Despite her disciplined attitude, she admits that she wants to speak with the Producer alone. Chinami helps her overcome her initial worries about this. She is impressed by Yumi Aiba’s ability to craft an elegant chocolate rose and Frederica Miyamoto’s impromptu song. Kiyomi and Tsukasa Kiryu were also kind enough to let Nao Kamiya get so sleep before a job and mistakenly think Clarice is napping alongside her."
Ako Tsuchiya,"Greedy, Friendly","Ako is the Passion representative of the New Wave trio. Her motivation for becoming an idol is to strike it rich and live a life of luxury with her best friends, Sakura Muramatsu and Izumi Ohishi. The trio is very close, and is almost never seen without the other members. Ako’s idol stage clothes always coordinate with Izumi and Sakura’s, and her cards are set up to work best with the other New Wave members. She wears glasses, has a beauty mark on her left cheek, and always has multicolored clips to keep her bangs in place.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Ako is a friendly girl who loves money and jewelry. Most of her idol adventures include her looking for prices or wondering about financial gain. She is closer to Sakura, due to their childlike behavior. She doesn’t seem to have much faith in her luck, and is very surprised when she wins a lottery prize of getting to go on a date with the Producer over a high class barbecue.

When her two friends try to convince her of what parts of her character to flesh out when going solo, she realize that she is viewed primarily as loving money. She is happy to learn that her tendency to drop funny lines is noticed and laughs with her friends as Sakura imitates Mirei Hayasaka."
Kotoha Tanaka,"Diligent, insecure","Kotoha is a very diligent girl with a passion for acting, though she often gets lost in it when doing so. If one had to describe what Kotoha is like in three words, it would be “an honors student”; she's diligent, takes everything seriously, does all work to her absolute best, and she just seems to be perfect at everything. Yet, she actually has low self-confidence. She often says that she has no any real talents (except maybe acting), and she has a somewhat fragile mentality. This makes Kotoha easily pressured by her work and she accumulates a lot of emotional stress from time to time, to the point that she occasionally breaks into tears. For example, in the event “Idol Symphony”, where Kotoha had been made the leader of the wind instrument group, the responsibility and lack of self-confidence lead her to break into tears in front of Megumi, as she felt that Megumi was more suited to be leader than she was. Fortunately, in those times, her two best friends, Megumi and Elena (and of course, the Producer), are often there to comfort her.

However, work is not the only thing that gives her stress-- her feelings for the Producer also cause her a lot of stress. Because of her lack of self-esteem, Kotoha is unable to confess her feelings, so she stresses herself out by trying to make herself look good in the Producer's eyes. This leads to many of her dialogues with the Producer sounding like she's going to break down in tears at any time. For example, in the Christmas event, when the Producer lent her his coat, she asked him whether he's only kind to her because she's an idol, and in the event “Idol Symphony” , when the Producer praised her and said that she's so good at her job that she’ll be fine even if he's not there, she became upset. She later confessed that she actually tried her best because she wanted the Producer to recognize and praise her, and he said that he needed Kotoha by his side. In conclusion, Kotoha is a diligent girl with confidence issues."
Mizuki Makabe,"kind-hearted, serious","Mizuki is a girl who rarely shows emotion on her face and she always wears a school uniform when she is not at work.

Although Mizuki rarely shows emotion, it doesn't mean that she's emotionless or a cold person. Mizuki has every emotion like other people do and she's definitely not a cold person; in fact, she actually has a kind heart. It’s just that she doesn't know how to express her emotions well, especially smiling, and Mizuki herself really wants to improve that.

Mizuki is also a well-mannered, very serious, and diligent girl, although her seriousness can be quite comical at times. She's also good at puzzles and poker, can do magic tricks, and is quite dexterous. Mizuki also enjoys deadpan humor. Like Akane, she has a mascot made in her likeness called “Little Mizuki”. Although, unlike Akane's mascot, which is only a doll, Little Mizuki has her own dialogue in card, but it’s not clear if this is just Mizuki doing Ventriloquism or if Little Mizuki is actually capable of speaking (whether by magic or technology)."
Fuka Toyokawa,"gentle, kind","Fuka has a gentle and kind personality and always tries to look after the other idols and the Producer, but that also has made her unable to refuse a request from people, even if it embarrasses her.

While many other busty idols either don’t realize their own sexiness or use it as their own weapon, Fuka considers her breast a source of embarrassment, given that people only look at her breasts wherever she goes. Thus, she wishes for a more classic idol image, but to her disappointment and frustration, most of the work the Producer finds for her is the sexy-type. With her gentle and quite easy to persuade personality, Fuka often finds herself unable to refuse sexy-type work and ends up doing it while complaining about how embarrassed she is and how she really wants to do more normal work. Though, as of lately, her definition of what is sexy has started to change. Some Producers perceive this as her ""training"" progressing nicely."
Roco Handa,"Creative, Sensitive","Roco is a positive girl who believes that she was born to be an idol, and she dreams of becoming a great artist using her own art style. Like many artists, Roco has weird habits that are hard for others to understand. The most apparent one would be her way of speaking--Roco likes to fill her sentences with English words, sometimes to the point of being almost impossible to understand. She prefers to use them even if they're not that common in usual speech. She will quickly correct herself if she accidentally catches herself not using a loanword, even though her English skills are not that good and she still occasionally requires a dictionary. When she's really concentrated or surprised, she’ll speak in a normal way, suggesting that she's doing this on purpose.

Roco’s artist skill covers a really wide range; she can draw, sculpt, design, create her own clothes, and even build a stage set by herself. Although, like many artists, her creative sense is hard to understand for normal people. In fact, most of the time they don’t even have any idea what she has created. She also likes to act as soon as she has inspiration, regardless of place and time. She'll also redesign objects on the spur of the moment (or in her own words ""roconize""), whether it’s a borrowed costume, a Drama’s set, or the office itself. Roco also likes to keep up with popular fashion, often changing her accessories from card to card. However, she always keeps her yellow headphones with her all the time and when she has to take them off, she gives them to the Producer while telling him not to lose them since they're important to her.

Although Roco always acts confident, deep down, she actually feels lonely, since her weird quirks and her hard-to-understand artistic sense often alienates her from the other idols. Roco is very happy when someone praises her art and she also shows her weak side to the Producer from time to time."
Sanae Nagatsuki,"Obsessive, Determined","Sanae is a main character who an obsessive crush over Ika Musume, much to Ika's dismay. She is constantly trying to claim Ika as hers by various means, none of which ultimately work."
Sistermon Blanc,"caring, diligent","Sistermon Blanc is a Puppet Digimon. It is a girl-shaped Digimon that looks like it's wearing a white rabbit, and is the younger sister of Sistermon Noir and Sistermon Ciel. In contrast to its elder sister Noir, it is slightly introverted, and it almost always hides behind its elder sister. It is caring for Hackmon just like its elder sister, and also acts as its escort while accompanying Gankoomon on its journey. Although it is trying to diligently carry out Gankoomon's request and assist in training with Hackmon, it frequently ends up reining in its elder sister's violent manner. A long time ago, in its previous life, it was out on the streets with its elder sister Noir, but they were saved by Gankoomon just as they were going to collapse from exhaustion. In order to repay Gankoomon for saving it and its elder sister, it puts all of its effort into being a chaperone for Hackmon. It coordinates with Jesmon, Noir, and nearby Digimon to respond to the unusual phenomena and signs of chaos that occur all over the Digital World. The triple-pronged ""Cross Barbée"" lance that it carries as a weapon has both an offensive side and a defensive side"
Nadia La Arwall,"brave, determined","Nadia is a 14 year old who works in a circus as an acrobat in order to survive, since she is an orphan and of unknown origins. She is chased by Grandis and her associates Sanson and Hanson, who are looking for the jewel that Nadia possesses, the Blue Water. While escaping from them, she meets Jean, and from that moment the two of them will be together in the series, where she tries to discover her origins and find out the truth about her past and the Blue Water, the jewel that seems to have an enormous intrinsic power."
Ankha,"snooty, gossiping","Ankha has bright golden fur, with navy blue stripes around her ears, tail, and paws. She wears makeup which makes her eyes resemble the Eye of Horus. When she is an islander in どうぶつの森 (Animal Forest) and どうぶつの森+ (Animal Crossing: Population Growing!), she wears a red floral ""Aloha Shirt"", while in later games, where she is a villager, she wears tightly wrapped bandages: the ""Mummy Shirt"". She wears an Egyptian headdress that resembles the Nemes crown and gives her the appearance of someone like Cleopatra. In 街へ行こうよどうぶつの森 (Animal Crossing: City Folk), Ankha's headdress contains a scarab charm in place of a cobra figurine.
Ankha has a オトナ (snooty) personality, which means she loves make-up and gossiping. In Japanese, she uses the pronoun あたし (atashi). As a snooty villager, Ankha will first appear rude and arrogant towards the player, often talking about herself and her own experiences. She also speaks about the style and appearance of other villagers, usually other female villagers such as 普通／私 (normal), 元気／アタイ(peppy), and other オトナ／ あたし (snooty) villagers.

K2,"outgoing, focused","The current standard service rifle for the Armed Forces of Republic of Korea, various political and economical factors at the time made South Korea invest and develop their own servicing firearm instead of using the Colt M16 rifles.

Operation of the K2 relies on long-stroke gas piston with rotating bolt, which was derived from the AKM. Fed with STANAG magazines, K2 is able to achieve a rate of fire of 750 rounds per minute. Default iron sights can provide 600 metres of effective firing range. Other than automatic and semi-automatic firing, K2 also features a 3-round burst fire mode.

The stock is made of polymer material, just like the pistol grip and forearm arm guard. When issued with bipods and 4× magnification scopes, K2 can also function as a DMR.

K2 rifle was only modernized in recent years to add combat accessory compatibility with the modernized warfare equipments. With the introduction of PVS-4K rail system, K2A variant can mount Picatinny rail compatible accessories on top of the gun, both side and bottom of the barrel. Grenadier units of the ROK Army also have access to DPI K201 40mm grenade launcher, which was designed and patterned after the American M203.

On top of the operating mechanism, M21 also have many similar design features of a Kalashnikov rifle, such as the right side charging handle, behind the well magazine catch/release.

Like most other modern modular assault rifle designs, M21 can attach specific combat accessories based on sortie needs, the gun is compatible with items such as bipod and vertical fore grip. A derived model of the Soviet GP-25 underslung 40mm grenade launcher unit was designed for and issued to M21, 22mm calibre rifle grenade can also be launched from the muzzle flash hider. To improve compatibility with NATO issue accessories, M21 can undergo modifications and mount Picatinny rails. M21 also features a foldable stock made of rigid polymer and rifle forearm guard made of heavy-duty synthetic material.

Zastava Arms have experimented with different barrel forging processes, other than the conventional rifling barrel, M21 and variants also have access to barrels with different twist rate or even polygonal rifling patterns, barrels made for M21 are all plated with hard chromium to achieve a longer service lifespan.

Other than the main battle rifle variant, M21 have two shorter variants labelled as M21 S (Shorter barrel assault rifle) and M21 C (Carbine), differ mostly in terms of barrel length, overall weapon size/dimension/weight and firing performance in terms of accuracy/effective range."

Special Automatic Rifle Val, a selective fire assault rifle developed by Soviet Union TsNIITochMash (Central Institute for Precision Machine Building), project aimed to create a rifle for urban combat and reconnaissance sorties, design finished in 1987. AS Val is also known as ""Shaft"".

Operating mechanism of Val is derived from the Kalashnikov gas-operated, rotating bolt design. Val is an assault rifle built to fire the 9x39mm calibre Soviet munitions, the primary munition for Val is the subsonic SP-6 high-performance AP rounds, Val is capable of firing them at a muzzle velocity of 295 m/s. Fed with a 20-round magazine, Val is able to achieve a rate of fire of 900 rounds per minute, up to an effective range of 300 metres, featuring a semi-automatic and a fully automatic fire mode. Similar to a Kalashnikov rifle, Val also features the right side charging handle, magazine release behind the well and a left side folding stock. Various optics can be mounted on Val with the Kalashnikov style clamp optic mount, accessories such as laser sight and fore-grip can be strapped on the suppressor.

Val's most notable design is the integrated suppressor, Val's barrel is only 200mm long but the large suppressor measures up to 284.36mm in length and 35.86mm in diameter. The suppressor itself wraps along the barrel, the barrel itself has a series of small ports drilled in the rifling grooves, leading into the suppressor which slows and cools the exhaust gases. The suppressor can be removed for cleaning, maintenance and storage but Val should not be fired without it fitted, as it can damage the weapon and can cause potentially harm the operator when to done so.

Due to the design being extremely expensive, AS Val was only produced in very tiny amount and supplied only to Russian military intelligence agencies, various Spetsnaz units and other selected army units under the GRAU designation 6P30. Val received overwhelmingly positive user feed backs, stating that the weapon's reliability rivaling that of an AKM assault rifle, remains reliably functional and accurate even under extreme conditions. Val took part in some of Russia's modern conflicts such as the Chechen wars, northern Caucasus conflicts and even the on going Syrian civil war.

Products derived from AS Val include the VSS Vintorez suppressed automatic sniper rifle and the SR-3 Vikhr compact assault rifles."

For some reason, whether it is because of her lack of self-confidence or due to cause and effects, she is afraid to look in a mirror."
Kaguya,"Lazy, Demanding","Princess Kaguya is a member of the Blood Maidens, and is known for her lazy attitude. Due to her lethargic personality, she constantly holes herself up in her room.

Despite her lazy demeanor, she may — or may not — have the ability to unleash the ""Truant Seven Tools"" from her skirt."
Gretel,"Curious, Inquisitive","A young girl who’s curious and inquisitive, but what doesn’t interest her is met with a lack of emotion. She has a habit of speaking without moral views.
She seems to hold an interest towards Jack, viewing him as a good-natured person. Because she lacks common sense, she says things which make even the Blood Maidens cringe, but she seems fine with that, and may even enjoy their reactions."

Naomi Evans is an aide to the investigators in the army military police investigation department. Learning to operate the self-propelled robot soldier called the ""Gun Turtle"" is said to be extremely difficult, but Naomi is able to operate as many as 4 at once. Excelling in close combat herself as well, she has won two championships in Titan's hand-to-hand tournaments. Originally, she was the eldest daughter of the mercantile house associating with House Bishop, but because of her time spent as a child with Lieri, she walked the path of military personnel in the steps of Lieri. Naturally, with going to the same government school as Lieri, Lieri has become more than just Naomi's senior officer, thinking of each other as true sisters. Because of Lieri's influence on her, she considers the savage, mass ideologies of the Neo Terrors, antiquated. Again, because of her superiority, she often attracts trouble from the male soldiers who look down on her as being bossy and arrogant."

She has become popular with the New Solars' citizens from those achievements and her lovely features, the New Solars' reasons being praised extravagantly due to her."

Afro Samurai,"Determined, Reserved","The former holder of the title ""Number Two,"" Afro is out to hunt down Justice, the man who killed his father for the rank of ""Number One."" From the time he was a child, Afro honed his skills as a swordsman; his style typically consists of wielding his sword with only his right hand while his left continues to hold on to his sheath, although during his fight with Jinno, he held his sword with both hands to compensate for Jinno's dual wielding speed. He is a very quiet individual, likely because the life of the ""Number Two"" does not allow him to have any close relationships with anyone, so when approached by others he says very little, if anything."
Idate,"cruel, sadistic","''Idate has shown a tendency to be cruel and sadistic with his actions, often referring to beating up others as ""playing"" with them. He also appears to be a heavy smoker. In his Wadanohara and the Great Blue Sea appearance, he is noticeably derogatory towards sharks, calling them ""stupid"" and ""just fish"". He even goes so far as to attack Samekichi unprovoked in hopes of eating him. In spite of his belligerence, he has been shown to be helpful, such as when he helped Tatsumiya escape at Wadanohara's request, although he claimed that he had nothing else to do.

Lev is blessed with natural physical ability, intuition and height. He declares that he's an ace even though he's a middle blocker. Kenma states that Lev is a good and honest guy.

Lev is quite childish and cheerful, shown when he was making fun of Hinata's height. Lev's appearance, as well as his piercing eyes, causes people to believe he is much more intimidating and serious than he actually is. Though he can be blunt, he never seems to mean any harm and adopts a playful attitude towards most things.
He is also shown to be enthusiastic about spiking as he gets excited about it very easily, and can be competitive with people he is interested in."
Rin Eba,"Bored, Manipulative","In the earlier parts of the manga, she has short brown hair that falls just above her shoulders, and usually wears a bored expression on her face.
As the series progresses, her hair grows longer, she grows half a foot, and she begins to wear clothing that flaunts her developing curves, hips, and breasts. She has changed so much that very few people recognize her when they meet her again.
At first, she is quite fond of her older brother (verging on a brother complex) and is irritated by Yuzuki, saying that she acts nice just for attention.

When studying physics and doing a VERY advanced experiment, you somehow accidentally crush a flux capacitor, causing Fumi to become stranded and naked in your timeline.

Fumi has a very serious personality. She talks in big words and is emotionless in the first few levels of interaction. She is driven only by work ethic. Her only interests are finding information on how to get back to her timeline and figuring out the the practical uses of of past tools/rituals. Her robotic personality is probably due to the oppressive time period she came from which only seems to value government efficiency (military, scientific research, etc.) and little on human individuality. She warms up to you as she begins to experience emotions she has never felt before."

After pitting the various heroines against each other so that only the strongest one would make it inside, she drew a gun on the surviving heroine to force her to cooperate because it was more fun that way. This turned out to be completely different from how Yumemi had wanted the situation handled, and Chiyuri was forced to fight the heroine so that Yumemi could collect research data about magic. Chiyuri was defeated much sooner than Yumemi had expected.

Chiyuri is currently believed to still be in Gensokyo along with Yumemi after her professor was kicked out of the Academy, because of the final ending of Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream.

In Chiyuri's own scenario, she is a native inhabitant of Gensokyo who can use magic, and is one of the many heroines who fight each other to gain access to the ruins. Inside, she is confronted by herself from another world, fighting with her to decide who's the stronger one, and goes on to battle Yumemi, who wishes to study her magic. This is, however, confusing."
Louise,"Polite, Determined","Louise (ルイズ Ruizu) was one of the many demons coming out of Makai into Gensokyo during Mystic Square. Although she denied it at first, she really did want to go to the human world. However, she had the bad luck of running into the heroine inside the border space between Gensokyo and Makai before making it out into the human world and was defeated. She was actually rather polite too."

During the events of Mystic Square, Sara attempted to prevent the heroine from entering Makai, referring to Reimu Hakurei as ""prey"".

When she arrives in Gensokyo, her ship, the Probability Space Hypervessel, is mistaken for some ordinary ruins by the inhabitants. She attempts to kidnap the heroine to use her as a research subject, but is ultimately defeated and sent home empty-handed. Yumemi is unfamiliar with both the magical and religious matters of Gensokyo, so she refers to Reimu Hakurei's power as magic, even when Reimu insists that it's actually divine power.

It is implied that her world of origin may not be the outside world as we know it, due to her profile and that of Chiyuri's, which suggests that a grand unified theory has been established, and there are 13 year-olds graduating from graduate school. Of note, however, is that in Magical Astronomy, which takes place in the future of the outside world, Maribel mentions that gravity was unified with the other forces recently, which could mean the grand unified theory has been established in the outside world."
Seiga Kaku,"prideful, manipulative","Seiga is a rather prideful girl who thinks Taoism is superior to other religions and tries to get people to convert. She acts to further her own goals, and nothing more, which is why she is labeled a wicked hermit and not accepted by the heavens. She doesn't seem to care about anyone, instead manipulating them for her own ends. Her revival of Yoshika's corpse shows her lack of regard for human rights. She doesn't appear interested in material possessions at all, despite her ability to pass through walls. However, in Symposium of Post-mysticism, she does take on a role of reverse-Santa Claus and steals people's belongings to sell back to whoever they bought it from.

She is someone who follows those she likes, but feels no particularly obligation to such people, making her alliance with Miko less assured than the other Taoists."

He resembles the sin of Sloth. In modern Japan, his sin is ""Gudon"" (The Imbecile) meaning Idiocy. His identification number that appears when the Kiznaivers experience pain is D-1.

Katsuhira is a tall, slim boy with droopy, grey eyes. He often has an emotionless expression on his face. He is usually seen wearing his school uniform which consists of a white shirt with black accents on the cuffs and collar as well as a blue tie with a black cross. He appears to be around 176 cm.

Katsuhira is rather indifferent in all situations, whether he feels pain or joy. He is shown to be emotionless and is also shown to be oblivious to the feelings of other people, despite wanting to build bonds. Due to his lack of interest in himself and others around him, he has trouble forming connections, with the exception of Chidori.

However, it seems like his lack of interest started in grade school, as Chidori's love confession stated that she wishes he would go back to his fun and caring self.

Katsuhira, despite having little emotion, does care for those around him, even to the point where he is willing to risk his own safety for the other Kiznaivers. His mood barely fluctuates, and he pays little attention to other people. He is constantly bullied, but doesn't feel the pain."

However, some time after the chaos caused by the civil war in her homeland and Rizevim's actions, she becomes much more calm, sweet, sensitive and kind, ultimately dropping her discriminatory and arrogant attitude.

Plum,"Timid, strategic","Plum is prince, representive and the last living male Dhampir. He lives in Oceando with the Seirens and asked Sora and Shiro for help with saving his species from extinction.

In the light novel Light Novel Volume 4, 『      』, with Izuna and Jibril found Plum, believed to be a Dhampir girl at the time, on the verge of dying of starvation. He asked them to give him their Soul Essence to avoid perishing. Jibril informed them that 'many bodily fluids contain[ed] varying amounts of soul essence'. Shiro helped him by telling him to lick Shiro's foot in order to consume her sweat. Plum stated that he likes the taste of Shiro's sweat. Jibril said it was because Shiro had a tough, strong, extremely rare, unique and noble soul that any common person who searched the entire world for such a presence would still never meet. After being saved by Shiro, Plum asked them to help his race.

Plum wears gothic clothing and a small top hat. He has blue hair and a black set of wings. He has also gotten a devilish looking tail.

Although initially believed to be a girl due to how he dresses, he eventually reveals that he is a boy and the last male Dhampir. He dresses like a girl to hide his actual gender.

He seems to be timid and easily prone to crying, but he is easily motivated at the prospect of obtaining fluids from Sora and Shiro due to their different attributions as they came from another world.

Like other Dhampires, he's very good at altering the perception of others with magic. He's also capable of creating a love potion so strong that it could pass as real love, something that neither Elves nor Flugels have been capable of despite their magical prowess over the other life form races of the Exceed. He is also good at shapeshifting, as he transformed into a scarf that gave Sora and Shiro the capability to fly during their game against the Flügel. This transformation has its own merits, as mostly Elves are the only ones who can use more than two spells at the same time.

He was able to fool a Flugel and a Phantasma using his Deception Spell after consuming a very little amount of blood from Sora. He even brags that at his maximum capacities, he could even fool an Old Deus (although he could have been exaggerating).

He proved himself a very capable strategist, having fooled even Sora and Shiro in his true gender for a while. He was almost able to manipulate the events of Light Novel Volume 4 & 5 into a win-win situation where if Sora and Shiro beat Laira's game, the Dhampirs thereby are able to feed on Imanity who now shoulder the responsibilities of the Seirens. If Sora and Shiro lost, then Plum would simply state that it was an offering of food for the Seirens and could possibly allow the Dhampirs to feed as well.

It is revealed that he can easily overwhelm Feel Nirvalen over magic despite the elf being a high-level magic caster by completely disable her means to use magic via illusion.

Like all Dhampirs, Plum will die when exposed to the sun's rays. He can combat this by utilizing magic to block out the sun's rays. However, it takes a large amount of energy to maintain and thus is better for him to use it while in a dark area (a wooden box for the case of going to the beach with the main characters in Light Novel Volume 4) to lessen the amount of energy required to maintain the spell.

Ever since tasting Shiro's sweat, Plum has had a taste for the siblings' soul essence to the point of it being somewhat of an addiction. As such, the siblings often used it as a means of bargaining with Plum to aid them on their journey. Without a steady apply of soul essence, it is difficult for a Dhampir to maintain a spell, rite, illusion, or form by shapeshifting. This is shown when Sora and Shiro are falling due to Plum running out of energy and telling the siblings that there is no sweat remaining on either of them. This prompts Sora to find a solution that allowed Plum to lick an open wound, thereby bypassing the curse with no repercussions.

Later the same day, Chiyoko is accidentally knocked down by a mysterious man running from police officers. Despite his hurried state, he takes the time to help Chiyoko to her feet and apologize for running into her. This act of kindness sticks out to Chiyoko, and so she sends the officers away from the man as he hides. She allows the man to stay in her store room in secret, where he tells her stories of his home, and how he hopes to finish his painting of the snowy landscape, once the war is over. Chiyoko is soon introduced to a skeleton key around the man's neck, which he addresses as the key to ""the most important thing there is."" Chiyoko asks that the man wait until the next day to tell her what the most important thing is.

Unfortunately, this chance never comes. Chiyoko returns to school to find the police discovered the man hiding in her store room, and finds his key outside, covered in blood from the man's injuries. The store clerk hints to Chiyoko that he fled to the train station, and Chiyoko hurries to follow him. She ultimately does not make it in time to stop him, and makes a promise that she will return the man's key to him no matter what. This drives her to sway from her mother's wishes, and Chiyoko begins making movies."

Azai Nagamasa,"Ambitious, Manipulative","Asai Nagamasa (浅井 長政) is the daimyo of the Oumi province. It is said that in order to reach Kyoto, one must deal with her, which makes her a slight obstacle for Oda Nobuna's plans. She is Yoshiharu Sagara's main rival throughout the series, and the two are shown to have much disdain for each other. She is introduced when she tries to make Nobuna her wife (note that at this point in the story, she is thought to be a man), not out of love, but to further her own plans for power. After being refused by the Oda clan she constantly tries to find ways to join forces and ends up married to Nobuna's sister Oichi (who funny enough is actually Nobukatsu in drag). She is based on the real-life historical figure Azai Nagamasa.

In episode 10, it is revealed that she is actually a woman, after being discovered at a woman's bathing area by Nobukatsu.

Initially a pure antagonist in the story, it is later revealed that she has a rather difficult past and tragic circumstances to deal with and ends up becoming more of an Anti-Villain or heroic antagonist who oposes Nobuna purely because of these circombstances. After her defeat, the death of Azai Nagamasa is made infamous by Nobuna turning her skull into a cup, when in reality, this was a cruel stunt Nobuna used to hide the fact that she had survived and adopted the name Oichi and become Nobukatsu's wife.

Her seiyuu is Saiga Mitsuki.Nagamasa has blue hair and, with some effort, can also mask herself as a man, However, beneath her disguise, she is actually quite boxum. She is taller than Yoshiharu and for that matter most girls her age.In the beginning, Azai Nagamasa strives for more power and control, and doesn't seem to pay attention to other pursuits. Like Nobuna, she seemed ambitious, except her motivations are more out of self-interest. Later on, to her father, she acknowledges that Nobuna will be the one to lead Japan, suggesting she is actually more considerate of those around her.

Although she tells Nobuna that love just ""gets in the way of things,"" she ends up accepting Nobutsumi as her husband rather easily, and longs for genuine affection from someone. It stands to reason she is just trying to convince herself that a female Daimyo needs to forgo her own happiness, partly due to her upbringing, and that in reality she is deeply conflicted because of it.

She would typically display a calm, manipulative exterior, and seemed to enjoy manipulating and using women, but she reveals later to Nobutsumi that it was purely a facade, and she did that so she would seem like a ""real man."" She's shown to strongly regret those attitudes.

It was often exaggerated that Nagamasa ""abandon females after he is done using them."" However this rumor was made based on simply how Nagamasa ""can do nothing but walk away silently"" from women who wish to have sex with her.

She has hinted many times that, inspite claiming she does not care either way, that she strongly dislikes the idea of war, and would much rather have peace. She resorts to begging when she finds Nobuna will go to war with her in provoked, and later pleads Azai Hisamasa to not betray the Oda clan and go to war, which gets her imprisoned. Furthermore, after marrying ""Oichi"" Nagamasa began to recognise Nobuna's talents and grew to admire her ""sister"" quite greatly, enough to consider killing her before she fell into the hands of Asakura Yoshikage, a fate presumably worse than dying.

Even though she and Yoshiharu are initially rivals, she hints that he has some respect for Yoshiharu, when she says that Yoshiharu will probably think of an unusual and creative plan.After escaping from their prison via Goemon's aid, Nagamasa realises that the Azai clan is now on the border of annihilation and is forced to return to it as an ally of the Asakura; effectively, she betrays Nobukatsu unwillingly and fights against the Oda clan from then on out.

During this time, she was torn between her loyalty to her father and clan, and her own feelings towards Nobukatsu, which are resprisented by the identities of Azai Nagamasa and Oichi respectively. She is also seen to still care for her ""enemies"" as she intends to kill Nobuna in order to spare her the demeaning fate that would follow should Asakura Yoshikage get his hands on her and she is disturbed upon hearing that the man in question even recklessly abandoned his own men to sneak into Nobuna's camp and attempt to abduct her. She has also expressed to herself the need to fight against Nobukatsu, eventually realising she must, and believing herself able to, kill him and throw aside her Oichi persona, but falters thanks to Yoshiharu's interferance. When the Azai-Asakura Alliance was brought to ruin and Nobuna destroyed Asakura Yoshikage's palace, she was confronted once more by Nobukatsu. She welcomed her death by his hand but Yoshiharu again interfered. Hearing her father had committed seppuku and that his final words were to let ""Azai Nagamasa"" die here so that Oichi could live on, she finally lets go of her Nagamasa personality. Her death is faked, with only Yoshiharu, Nobukatsu, and those closest to them, such as Nobuna, knowing the truth; Nobukatsu did not even inform his own mother of this fact. She permanently adopts to persona of Oichi and is later happily welcomed into the Oda clan as Nobukatsu's wife by Nobuna."
Razette,"shy, kind","Razette is a minor protagonist and one of the few recurring female characters in the 07-Ghost series. She is a Noel Mermaid, and lives in the Church reservoir.

Razette is close to Bishop Castor and has known him for a long time, from when he was a human. She was resurrected by Castor (who became one of the Seven Ghosts), after taking her own life in grief over Castor's death (as a human), so she now shares half of his life force. She is mute (unable to speak), but can sing, and is the organist for the Church. Razette also works as one of the Church's nuns and is the only non-human nun there.Razette is a Noel mermaid and as she has roughly the same height and build as Teito she can be estimated to be 5 foot 3 inches tall and weigh 43 kg. Razette has a very petite, slim build with a light blue fish-tail in place of legs when in water. However, when not submerged, Razette is able to transform her tail into a pair of legs with webbed feet. Around her hips she has a tuft of white fur, and the same white fur also on her chest and down her back. She also has long fins on her hips the same colour as her tail.

Strangely, when Razette is out of water, she has human-like legs and feet. Razette's face is round, having a peachy skin-tone, with large pink-purple eyes, a small nose, and a small mouth with full lips. Her hair is bright pink in colour, straight, and reaches her mid-back; she wears her fringe to the right and has two longer bangs to frame her face. Razette is considered very pretty in the series universe, with quite a few characters calling her so.

Her more aquatic features include fins in place of ears as well as webbed hands. In the manga, her appearance is distinctly more 'alien' than in the anime; in the manga, her forearms and wrists are rather bulky with long fins on them. 

Razette's age is unknown, but she physically appears to be in her mid to late teens although it is likely that she is as old as, if not older than, Castor.Due to her tail and the fur on her chest, Razette does not normally need to wear clothes other than the red bow worn around her neck, as she does not need to cover herself. However when playing the organ, Razette wears the attire of a nun (called a habit) which consists of a black tunic, a wimple over the tunic, and a white scapular over her shoulders. She also wears a solid veil on her head.Razette is a shy, quiet person with a very kind and helpful personality.[3] She is nervous and flighty around strangers, but more sociable and friendly to those she likes. Loyal and clannish, while she sometimes hides from strangers, she is no stranger to confrontation- and can become aggressive when threatened.[4] Razette cares deeply for and is very protective of her friends, especially Castor, as shown when she was willing to sacrifice herself in order for his life to be spared.

Razette can also be seen as playful, as she seems to enjoy startling people by changing her face to look like theirs. She is expressive-despite not being able to speak, she never has difficulty conveying meaning with facial expressions and gestures."

Teshima Junta,"Fiercely competitive, Humble","Teshima Junta is a second-year student at Sohoku High School and a member of the Sohoku High Bicycle Club. While he is unable to make the Inter High team during his second year, he was announced by Kinjou Shingo to be captain of the cycling club during his third year and beats his teammate and old friend Koga to secure his spot on the Inter High team.Teshima has fairly long, wavy hair, which he sometimes wears back in a ponytail. In pictures colored by the mangaka, he is depicted with shades of blue and purple in his hair and eyes, and he is initially depicted with much curlier hair. In the anime, Teshima's hair is solid black. For the movie, Teshima is given more violet-toned hair and blue eyes. He is often shown wearing shirts with star designs on them. In year three, his design also feature English teaspoon, small milk jug and tea cup.Teshima is very smart and uses strategies to win races along with his close friend Aoyagi. Seemingly nonchalant, condescending, and teasing at first, he acts subtly hostile towards the first-years to prevent them from joining the Inter High team. It's shown that Teshima has a complex as an ""ordinary"" cyclist that cannot reach the top world of ""elite"" cyclists, which is why he works with Aoyagi as a ""team of two"". He is a thoroughly hard worker, but doesn't have much confidence in his own cycling abilities and easily resigns himself to his status (and nearly quits cycling because of it) before entering high school and witnessing an Inter High race. Teshima tends to damper his emotions when things go wrong, accepting failure as the fate of someone ""ordinary"", but he has a fierce, competitive desire to win and can become quite emotionally charged when he refuses to accept that he's unable to achieve anything.

As it turns out, Teshima is very humble and supportive of Sohoku's cycling team after his loss, even to those who've personally defeated him. It's as if his hostile nature beforehand was circumstantial, simply born from his desire to win and ride with his mentor Tadokoro before the third-year graduated. During downtime with the first-years, it's shown that they've reconciled their differences and have bonded with him and Aoyagi[2][3], and he takes his role on the support team during the 41st Summer Inter High very seriously. He's willing to physically push team members who've fallen behind and ease their mental state from the reality of their situation. Teshima believes in his teammates, and encourages others (particularly Sugimoto, Naruko and Onoda) to believe in them as well.

After Inter High, when he became the captain, he has become very adept at encouraging Imaizumi and Naruko, namely to convince the former to spend more time to discover and compliment Sadatoki's effort and talents, and allow the latter to take indefinite leave so Naruko can consider his future as a sprinter in Osaka.

He also uses his own psychological warfare to psych out opponent and cast doubt over his own teammates (even when the person in question or is 'uncertain to make the team' is actually himself), as shown by the 1000km training camp when he explained that he is the unconfirmed member rather than Kaburagi Issa when he races against Koga Kimitaka as they settle old scores. He also likes to state the obvious, but is also good at putting the obvious into practice, which are mostly the fundamentals."

Despite this, Empowered is a kind, caring person, unlike most other superheroes in her universe. 

Emp is a 20-something super heroine and associate-member of the Superhomeys superhero group. Her powers and abilities are derived from a super suit of unknown origin and nature (the suit literally ""fell out of the sky"" in an envelope addressed to her). This suit, while being Emp’s source of power, has also made her a social laughingstock as it often fails her when she needs it the most. This is due to the suit’s material, known as a “hyper membrane”, being incredibly thin and incredibly skin-tight, while also being extremely fragile and sometimes uncooperative.

Despite these shortcomings, Empowered’s super suit has steadily become more useful and resilient with new abilities being revealed as the series progresses. Additionally, Emp’s suit has been implied to have been bonded specifically to her, and has been shown to be completely useless when worn by other people. The suit's odd behaviour and contradictory properties (such as being able to stop bullets and shark bites, yet also extremely fragile) are at least partially a result of Elissa's psychological difficulties and limitations.

Emp’s super suit imparts both voluntary powers, controlled intentionally by the wearer, and involuntary powers; passive abilities that become active without conscious intent of the wearer, and physical attributes that do not necessarily enhance the function of the suit but are active nonetheless. Powers include superhuman strength, invisibility, various visual enhancements including magnification and x-ray vision, the ability to cling to all surfaces, high-intensity directed energy discharges, damage protection, suit regeneration, vacuum support, powered-up independent action, and other miscellaneous powers."

Kazusano Kazuki,"determined, competitive","The main antagonist of the second season, her purpose is to awaken Ikkou so that she can release her innate and uncontrollable spiritual powers. Even though she has an antagonistic role in the series, in another sense she seems to be on Ikkou's side - that is, she seems to want to enjoy her youth as much as Ikkou does, and in much the same way - with a member of the opposite sex. She states that she wants to help him in developing his spiritual powers, although what she seems to consider ""helping"" is different from what the protagonists would consider helping. Since Ikkou's powers are dangerous, the nuns of Saienji hope for Ikkou to restrain himself from using his power too much, while Kazuki seems to believe that the very nature of his powers are essentially good and therefore incapable of doing harm. (The last episode of the series confirms that a strong, uncontrolled awakening can be warped into a force for evil, causing riots and the like.) Nonetheless, she does not seem to want to hurt Ikkou, and while her infatuation with him makes her forceful and competitive (even to the point of violence against Chitose), she is very determined and puts in strong effort to realize a goal that ought to be easier than it apparently is which is to be happy with Ikkou.

Atsumi Munakata,"exuberant, forward","Atsumi is an exuberant and touchy-feely girl. Simply put, she is a super-energetic girl with a great love of the female body. Her love extends so far that she enjoys foods like soft buns. She became an idol to make lots of female friends, and maybe even engage in some ""skinship"" with them. When it comes to describing other women, she talks rather perversely, and she is often found gazing at other idols’ bodies. 

Her attention span to an assignment is proportionally reduced as the quantity of surrounding beautiful females is increased. This was especially shown at the Hawaiian Beach event, where she was part of the idol group. Atsumi made sure to bring a camera. 

Atsumi often schemes up ideas to get other idols to allow her to fondle their breasts, although she has been known to occasionally go overboard. Some idols have managed to use this against her, such as Helen and Manami Kiba. 

In the tie-in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Atsumi proves herself to be very forward in promoting skinship with her fellow idols. When she went into a daydreaming frenzy, Manami Kiba drew her out of it by placing her on her lap and under her own cleavage. Atsumi underwent her own Dream Festival, trying to get other idols’ permission to fondle their breasts. She employed tactics such as acting like a little sister and bribery.

Miyako Anzai,"Inquisitive, Playful","Miyako is a girl with a strong love of detective dramas and mystery in general. As a result, she tends to act out her love of them by pretending to be a detective, and she seems to have quite a bit of talent at it. Claiming that she was born to be a detective, she proves to be an inquisitive junior crime solver and aspiring detective. She uses an inner monologue when sleuthing a target and has been known to use common character tropes to solve cases, such as finding out that the butler committed a crime. In that particular instance, the Producer played as the guilty butler during a stage play with the idols.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Miyako’s detective skills are played up. She became an amateur sleuth at a very young age, and keeps a picture of the day she started. She likes to learn more about her fellow idols through interviews or interrogations, and has found out about Ayame Hamaguchi’s past this way. She tried to find the secrets behind Noa Takamine, but was instead found out and scolded. She has trouble studying, is bad at English and uses the philosophy of looking smart equals being smart.

Her first Idol Topic in Starlight Stage and her listed hobbies say that she 'looks' at novels rather than 'reading' them. This was explained in the Refresh Room story featuring Miyako and Yoriko Furusawa, where it is revealed that although Miyako is often seen 'reading' mystery novels around the office, she only 'looks' at them, as she likes to try to solve the mysteries with only the illustrations, saying that it's good practice for honing her deductive powers."
Clarice,"Compassionate, Kind","Clarice is a compassionate and kind woman of faith. With a love of choir music, she seeks to become an idol to spread joy and happiness. Clarice uses the money she makes as an idol to run charities and pay church bills, all while never keeping any for herself. She is depicted as one of the most levelheaded and mature idols, and as a good listener, due to confessional experience. Clarice will also take the duty of helping out others and take charge of situations in a heartbeat. When faced as a rival by other idols, she considers her defeat to be a sign from God, because the Producer is a good man who cares for others. Due to her work as a woman of faith, she's not very used to being around men.

Interestingly, the exact nature of her blindness is not specified, perhaps because she was not originally intended to be. She is able to wander locations without use of a walking stick or trained dog, and she hasn’t been seen with scripts or lyric sheets written in braille. However, two of her cards display her having problems from lack of sight: the first with the Producer accompanying her to an art museum to describe the exhibits, and the second with her tripping in a messy room and needing the Producer to gather the papers she dropped.

Additionally, Clarice's religion is kept very vague- it resembles Catholicism in most aspects, but varies from it as well. She is obviously a nun and talks about God and Heaven, but the series never delves into it further than that.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Clarice is shown to be a calm and reserved young woman. She is able to silence Kirari Moroboshi with only a stern look, although it’s hinted that the taller girl may have seen Clarice’s eyes. She believes it is very bad to let food go to waste, and as such forces herself to eat Natalia’s disgusting banana and sushi combination. She believes Christmas to be a peaceful and splendid day that should be void of all conflict. Shiori Sena and Marina Sawada both admit that they would like Clarice to officiate their future weddings. Tsukasa Kiryu and Kiyomi Saejima mistakenly assume her to be asleep due to her always closed eyes."

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Tsubaki’s photography skills are played up considerably. Tsubaki is rather laid back, and her advice for other idols tends to reflect this. Her camera skills show that while she can take very amazing and memorable photos, she also can capture some rather scandalous images too. Her philosophy for picture taking is that taking a relaxed approach allows for more interesting pictures. Tsubaki has been asked to work for Makino Yagami and Reina Koseki, but she teasingly states that her work is for her personal usage. She also likes the fortune aspect of visiting shrines on New Years."
Mai Fukuyama,"responsible, mature","Among the younger idols, Mai Fukuyama is one of the more mature and composed girls. She's very responsible, to the point where her school's class and year representatives leave things like class greetings to her.

It was revealed in Starlight Stage that before she became an idol, Mai used to be a child actress. After being encouraged by her mother, Mai decided to try being an idol. She took a liking to the Producer as he reminds Mai of her mother; who always encourages her to try new experiences so that she can find what she enjoys most."
Akiha Ikebukuro,"Inventive, Enthusiastic","Akiha is a 14-year old prodigy with a natural talent for robotics. Considered a genius, she often is seen tinkering and building machines and robots. Akiha has a habit of equipping her robots with a huge array of functions totally irrelevant to what they were made for in the first place.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Akiha’s robotics prowess is on full display. She appears to be very reverent of Ritsuko Akizuki and is close friends with Yoriko Furusawa. Her enthusiasm for robots and creative energy allow her to make creations on the spot, albeit with a single track mind. Some of the various inventions she has created are hinabots (robots based on dolls), crepe making robots, and a specialized cheering megaphone."
Shinobu Kudo,"Determined, supportive","Shinobu is a girl who has dreamed of being an idol since childhood and grew up admiring and listening to them from afar on her radio. Both her parents and her friends say she isn't cut out to be an idol, but she moves to Tokyo on her own nonetheless to join the Producer's talent agency. Ultimately, she is able to follow her dreams of stardom in spite of everyone around discouraging her. In her plus card, her parents call to apologize.

She was initially paired up with another idol themed around hard work, Honoka Ayase. Since then, both Azuki Momoi and Yuzu Kitami have seemed to join their group of friends.

In the tie-in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Shinobu reveals that she wants to be a Top Idol so she can pay back the Producer for all of his hard work. Shinobu had a Tohoku regional accent as a child but devoted a great deal of time to listening to Tokyo radio and improving her diction to lose it. She likes the school uniforms her job as an idol allows her to wear. She dreamt of Kako Takafuji on the first day of the New Year and wound up winning a lottery prize. She is rather rigid when compared to some of the adult idols, but she sets up a goal to become more laid back. Shinobu occasionally worries that her comic collection qualifies her as an otaku.

Shinobu met Honoka Ayase while playing a crane game, hoping to help her friend get a Kuma Tomo bear as a prize. Honoka’s pursuit to catch a green cat-like doll (which she later name Pinyakorata) allowed her to get several other stuffed animals. When Shinobu couldn’t manage to get any toys herself, Honoka gave her several of her own and Shinobu created a “Honoka zone” in her room for them. The two became extremely close friends while going out to eat together, and drew in Yuzu Kitami and Azuki Momoi into their group. Since then, the four girls were usually shown together with Pinyakorata as their major theme. When going to the amusement park, Honoka’s interest in her green cat plushie carried over to a matching hat set, and the quartet decided to get Pinyakorata hats."
Saya Matsubara,"Cute, Enthusiastic","Saya is the boss of the Ikebukuro area. She is a cutesy young woman who has her eyes set on the Producer ever since she first saw him. She speaks in the third person, and her casual wear outfits are sweet lolita dresses.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Saya shows a severe lack of stamina when training with Ema Senzaki and Rumi Wakui. To help her out, she has recently started taking protein supplements stating that they are easy to mix in with food and have a variety of tastes."
Azuki Momoi,"Cheerful, Creative","In Starlight Stage, Azuki arrived slightly late to her audition. She said this was her ""Operation G"". When the Producer asked about it, she explained that it was the ""barely getting to the location in time to look more important"" operation. She also told the Producer that she was the poster girl of a textile shop, thinking that it was fitting for an idol. She said that if she doesn't become an idol, she would be inheriting the textile shop, and that she really wants to become an idol. When she was scouted, she happily told the Producer that operation ""poor little me"" was a success, and explained how it worked. She calls her lessons ""my idol training"" operations. She expressed that her dream is to become a sexy idol; and as such she also started ""Operation S"". Azuki admitted that she is a good actress, but she lacks the experience and skills for sexy roles.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Azuki is shown to be a bright and cheerful girl who loves looking cute. She is depicted as having crazy ideas, such as trying to force Reina Koseki into liking being cute or splitting an already cut apple tart five ways. She admits that she tries to make sexy poses despite being a cute idol. Interestingly, while she is underage, she was initially paired up with idols who became intoxicated when she was around. Since then, she has become close friends with Honoka Ayase, Shinobu Kudo and Yuzu Kitami."
Sakura Muramatsu,"Sweet, fun-loving","Sakura is the Cute representative of the New Wave trio. Sakura is the sweet, fun-loving spirit that serves as the heart of her unit. She has a speech style where she stretches out words and uses ""super"" a lot. Her favorite color is pink, but onstage she normally wears red for the sake of completing the primary colors with her friends, Ako Tsuchiya and Izumi Ohishi. The trio is very close, and is almost never seen without the other members. Sakura’s idol stage clothes always coordinate with Ako and Izumi’s, and her cards are set up to work best with the other New Wave members. She usually wears a single, large bow or headbands with bows attached.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Sakura is particularly close to Ako due to them both being very childlike. She likes to wear dresses and enjoys playing with Momoka Sakurai’s dogs. Sakura tends to get distracted easily, as she lets her pastries burn when practicing for a singing and baking simultaneous job. When she lost to Izumi in Hanetsuki, she had her face painted to match Mirei Hayasaka’s eye patch. For some reason, Yukari Mizumoto holds Sakura saying that she’d make dinner to be good advice for performing at live events.

Sakura loves being with Izumi and Ako, to the point of wanting to live with them. When her two friends try to convince her of what parts of her character to flesh out when going solo, they simply point out that Sakura tends to be cute no matter what she tries. She eventually accepts that and decides to keep it as her selling point."
Hasumi Nagatomi,"Nostalgic, Passionate","Hasumi loves retro things, and has dreamt of being an idol ever since she was a little girl; this was probably helped by her mother, who has an admiration of the idols of the past. Because of this Hasumi believes the best fashion trends happened decades ago. Her taste of fashion reflects costumes from the 1950’s, the 1960’s, and the 1970’s. Other idols consider her outfit choices to be too nostalgic.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Hasumi appears to be very nostalgic and clearly enjoys old fashioned things. She has had her photo shoot pictures taken in sepia for a retro feel. She likes sweet pea flowers, and has described her fans as an army."
Hitomi Niwa,"Knowledgeable, Enthusiastic","Hitomi is an idol from Nagoya with tremendous interest in her country's feudal history. She can cite encyclopedic knowledge of figures like Hattori Hanzou, Miyamoto Musashi and Yagyu Jubei. Hitomi travels around Japan with tour guides that explain what major battles or significant historic events took place in the location. Some of her idol costumes also contain some elements of samurai wear.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Hitomi shows her knowledge base on the feudal lords of Japan. She often compares her fellow idols to famous historical figures and references various battles. She will occasionally start to imagine that she is one of those figures, and will act as them during entire conversations. Admittedly, she won’t eat fish from the head like a general, as she finds that to be disgusting. Hitomi appears to be a very skilled actress and tour guide. She also is friends with Honami Nishikawa and Ayame Hamaguchi. She doesn’t have much interest in Asai Nagamasa."
Michiru Ohara,"Cheerful, Gluttonous","Michiru is a rather cheerful girl with a voracious appetite for food that can never be sated. If she isn't eating something, there's zero doubt she thinking about eating something. She gets easily distracted by food, no matter the type, usually to the point of ignoring everything around her. Official artwork depicts her as tending to focus on baked goods though, and for good reason, as her parents own a bakery.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Michiru is introduced by Cathy Graham. She used to work at the “Ohara’s Bakery” shop, but could never properly work as a showgirl due to her always eating the merchandise. She is almost never seen without bread on her person, and she seems to favor café lattes. When choosing sweets, she takes on a very serious demeanor."
Miyabi Tsukimiya,"sweet, hardworking","Miyabi is a sweet young woman who adores her mother and spends a lot of time with her. From her speech it's deduced that her mother tried to be an idol but failed, and Miyabi tries to accomplish that dream. She is obviously spoiled by her mother, but she's gentle with Producer and always tries to make his work easier. She refers to herself as ""Miyabii"".

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Miyabi is shown to be a hardworking girl. She likes to practice her swimsuit poses when at the beach. She initially believes Tomoe Murakami to be a feminine girl, but is quick to find that she is actually a female supremacist. One job had her working as a maid, but she dropped her tray in worry over Yukimi Sajo. Thankfully, Chiaki Kurokawa caught it. She is also the one to tell Ayaka Kishibe that wearing a wedding dress will make her marry late."
Kozue Yusa,"Innocent, naive","Kozue is an innocent yet absent-minded girl recruited by the Producer. She is quite inquisitive, with slight hints that she's lived a somewhat sheltered life. She tends to elongate any end vowel and speaks entirely in hiragana. It’s possible that this is due to the fact that she dozes off from time to time.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Kozue is introduced by Hasumi Nagatomi. Always drowsy, she appears to be extremely innocent. She tries to wish on a star, but seems to have trouble coming up with an idea. Her idea of fun is speaking through a fan and telling others that she is an alien. Kozue likes animal crackers and enjoys spending playtime with Aya Kirino."
Chinatsu Aikawa,"intelligent, cold","Chinatsu is considered to be an intelligent, refined girl with an interest in fashion. Always donning her glasses, she is depicted as smart and cold. However, she has gained a friend in Yui Ohtsuki, after they were paired together as a duet for a New Year's concert. Yui tends to call her Chinattan. The duo plays off of their “opposites attract” ideology, as Chinatsu is usually shown as a cold, hipster artist and Yui promotes being a bubbly popstar.

In Starlight Stage, it's revealed that she met the Producer at a cafe and initially asked him not to bother her, but when he mentioned being an idol she stated that she wasn't interested in singing or dancing but was interested in challenging herself.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, she emphasizes believing in one’s self. She is reverent of Ritsuko Akizuki, and seems to be very sensitive on how others feel. She sticks up for her fellow idols and isn’t afraid to teach them a lesson, which Reina Koseki has found out in the past. She has been viewed as a sort of authority figure for some of the teenaged girls."
Kate,"naive, playful","Kate is a Britianian whose visit to Japan led to becoming an idol. While her hometown is listed as England, it’s made clear that she is specifically from London. She enjoys British pubs. Her notable physical features tend to be her large eyebrows and numerous freckles.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, she seems to not know much about Japan’s culture or laws, as she is quick to believe minors can drive when she mistakes Wakaba Kusakabe for a child. She seems to like puns. When she tries to put her hair in pigtails, Kate admits her hair simply won’t come together. She was amazed when Yuu Ohta managed to create a chocolate figurine of her dog, but easily believed that she may have harmed the dog by mistake."
Koharu Fujiwara,"Responsible, Caring","A second year who is the vice-president of the student council in her school. She is hard working and has the grades to show for it, which makes both the student and the teacher body admire her, although she often ignores her own well-being for the sake of work.
At home she looks after her younger siblings to take a load off her mother's shoulders and as such is really close to her younger brother Fuyuto. 
After getting closer to Mr. Yabe she has begun to learn how to act in her own interest more often."
Ayaka Kishibe,"refined, charming","In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, she can be seen wishing to be with Producer on White Day and introduces the idols Risa Matoba, Kanna Ariura, and Layla. She is handy with a hair dryer and curler, as she decorates Uzuki Shimamura and Rin Shibuya’s hair as a surprise. Ayaka considers her refinement to be a personality bonus, and wears a wedding dress as her best choice for a photoshoot. When she is told that wearing the dress will make her marry late, Ayaka responds by saying that she’ll have the Producer take responsibility."
Midori Mizuno,"calm, earnest","Midori is a refined, calm national archery champion from Hiroshima. The archery aspect of her is played up as her main non-idol talent. She has been known to shatter target boards with her shots, and takes it very seriously when comes to games of skill that involve aiming at a target or hitting a bullseye. She seems to have lived a sheltered life, as she didn't know the dangers of alcoholic drinks when with other idols.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Midori is depicted as earnest and beautiful, but is quickly proven to be a complete airhead. She easily caught up in fun and likes to play darts. Midori also seems to be well recognizable by fans, and is suggested to wear an archer styled swimsuit in order to boost her confidence.

In THE iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls: Starlight Stage, it is revealed that she is very popular among girls from her school's archery club."
Yume Narumiya,"shy, nurturing","In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, the other idols are often shown as being kind and protective of Yume. Always extremely shy, she is completely embarrassed upon seeing Hinako Kita’s painting. She acts as a “soothing green wind” character in Chika Yokoyama’s magical girl TV show, and plays the ocarina in the “Little Marching Band Girls” unit. Yume bought the ocarina after reading a story and hoped to call forth fairies. Instead, she brought forth the unit of band members, became their seventh member, and helped convince Wakaba Kusakabe to become the final member."
Kuroi Tasuku,"Harsh, Compassionate","She has a harsh personality but beneath that is a heart of gold. She has a distinct ""D"" tattoo on her right cheek and a piercing on her lower left lip. When fighting she only wears a strapless bra and a long skirt. As a Tasmanian devil she has razor-sharp claws and fangs and a powerful bite."
Yasuha Okazaki,"Childlike, refined","Yasuha is a former child actress who had a lonely childhood. She has a lot of experience in the entertainment business (even being called senpai by older idols, and considered one of the most experienced out of all of the Cinderella Girls idols), but she doesn't have memories of a normal childhood, leading to her unusually childlike behavior. Yasuha’s childlike tendencies have influenced her hobbies.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Yasuha is shown to be very childlike, but very refined as well. She enjoys making dollhouses, is noted to have personality similarities to a sheep, and was the first to point out that Nono Morikubo related to a squirrel. Yasuha hopes to shine like a star someday, and believes that she will use her past experiences to move forward. She seems to be close to Yuuki Otokura, and has had to help Kako Takafuji when the latter has trouble coming up with idol-like challenges.

Due to her past, she did not have any special pictures of her childhood. Miyako Anzai and Syuko Shiomi have decided to help her start her own picture collection."
Koharuko Koiwai,"Serious, Confused","She is presumed to be the younger sister of Yousuke (Yotsuba's father), and therefore Yotsuba's aunt. She refers to Yousuke as onii-chan, which means ""older brother"". She lives in Tokyo and does not interact with the Koiwai family very often.

Yotsuba described her as ""someone who often bumps into a corner with her hands or feet"". She seems to be not so good at dealing with children as she constantly keeps a serious expression on her face and is direct with her words. She often gets confused with Yotsuba and Yousuke's antics.

Asagi Ayase,"Teasing, Irreverent","The eldest of the three Ayase sisters, Asagi lives at home while attending a nearby university. She is depicted as an attractive young woman who enjoys teasing people, especially her parents; her friend Torako describes her as a horrible person for teasing Ena. She is the best of her family at managing Yotsuba, and her mother claims she was much like Yotsuba when she was young. Asagi's irreverence may have come from her mother's teasing when she was a child.

Noa Takamine,"Mysterious, Trusting","Noa is a mysterious silver-haired beauty with a flair for technology and seemingly endless list of natural skills. She enjoys having a futuristic style when on stage, and her idol costumes reflect her fascination with futuristic fashion. She is initially unwelcome of the Producer but learns to trust him. Her mysterious looks are someone reminiscent of Takane Shijou, as Noa shares odd quirks, silver hair, an unusual height, and stares into the night sky.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Noa is shown to be a very mysterious and secretive girl. She is very good at domestic skills, such as cleaning and cooking, and seems to have an odd tracking ability. Noa believes that idols should analyze and understand the true meanings behind wearing skimpy costumes. She also lands the lead role of a Wild West film."
Rumi Wakui,"Ambitious, Caring","Rumi is a woman who sacrificed her personal life to put an office career before everything else. She avoided having a social life to dedicate herself to work advancement, and even cut her hair to a boyish length because she didn't want being feminine to be a career issue. Her ambition led her to become a company manager, but also forced her into being single.

Despite being allergic to them, Rumi really loves cats and can't avoid hugging them when she sees one.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Rumi is often seen caring for her fellow idols, and takes on an almost motherly tone with Takumi Mukai and Tomoka Wakabayashi. Her love of cats often appears to get the best of her, causing her to have allergic reactions during lessons. She proves that she’s an extremely good tennis player, playing a competitive match that lasted well over an hour and 30 minutes with the Producer. Believing that she has lost her concentration she attempts to focus on flower arranging, but feels at a loss when she passes on the opportunity to pet a cat."
Mary Cochran,"Proud, Attention-seeking","Mary is a young American fashionista. She left her home in San Francisco to become an idol in Japan. She likes to be treated as a noble lady and to be the center of attention. However she still feels lonely, as she often calls out for her mother when asleep. Mary likes to eat, but only the best of foods.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Mary is a proud little actress who seeks to be the center of attention and to be viewed as an adult lady. She believes herself to be the cutest and sexiest of her friends, tries to act more mature that she really is, and claims she is more popular than most of her fellow idols. This all tends to backfire on her. While she’s aware that she hasn't hit puberty, she’s still upset about her bust size when in comparison to idols like Satomi Sakakibara. She seems to be friends with Yui Ohtsuki and apparently sees Risa Matoba as a mentor. Hitomi Niwa points out that she and Honami Nishikawa have a mother daughter relationship.

Mary doesn’t seem to understand many Japanese customs, or the Japanese film industry. She believes that to be a movie star, she has to wear a top knot wig until the Producer stops her."
Shiho Makihara,"Cheerful, Caring","Shiho is the waitress of a Maid Cafe that specializes in sundaes and sweetened tea. Shiho herself has a severe sweet tooth, and will often try to make her customers buy some of the shop’s sweets. She continues to work part-time upon becoming an idol, and her idol costumes use her maid job as a theme. Her hips measurement are among the highest and without a larger bust size.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Shiho uses the skills she learned as a maid in her idol work as well. Most of her appearances depict her as a food and drinks server. She particularly likes tea and coffee. During an event, she worked with Ai Togo to fix the messes Koume Shirasaka and Frederica Miyamoto were creating while at a maid cafe. She later introduced Asuka Ninomiya, Tokiko Zaizen, and Kurumi Ohnuma to the cast and planned to feed everyone sweets in their sleep as a Christmas present."
Kai Nishijima,"passionate, adventurous","Kai is a young and talented swimmer from Osaka who is very passionate about swimming and idol work. Half of her cards feature her wearing swimsuits or swimsuit-inspired idol outfits due to her hobbies and skill sets.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Kai is an avid swimmer with an adventurous spirit. She encourages Mutsumi Ujiie to help her instigate dolphins to get splashed by them. Kai’s fashion sense has proved to be somewhat troublesome, as she doesn’t like skirts and has difficulty not wearing a swimsuit as her casual street clothes. She knows of Sanae Katagiri’s drinking habits and has trouble keeping up with Arisa Mochida’s enthusiasm on the beach."
Aoi Shuto,"Energetic, Enthusiastic","Aoi is a young girl from Oita whose family owns a boarding house. She's been raised as its heir since she was little, and taught to cook as part of her boarding house owner training. Always energetic, she usually wears kimonos or kimono inspired outfits. She was raised to become a yamato nadeshiko.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Aoi is a happy kid who appears to love fish and cooking with them. She loves the sea, believing it to be a treasure trove of food, which startled Shiori Sena. Aoi participated in a Dream Festival match with Hajime Fujiwara, Kiyora Yanagi, and Kumiko Matsuyama where her cooking skills were extremely well accepted. She is at a loss when talking about love with older idols, but she loudly proclaims that cooking is like love instead. It was her idea to decorate the company office with hinamatsuri dolls. She is bad with worms and has problems with Kako Takafuji’s antics while trying to be an idol."
Natsumi Soma,"impatient, worried","Natsumi is an airline stewardess who accepted the Producer's offer to become an idol. She also gets many idol costumes themed as sexy versions of stewardess' uniforms.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Natsumi maintains her flight attendant skills. When she actually takes a flight with the Producer, she is impatient when she can’t help with her old job and accidentally scares him with some airline trivia. She is very wary of her weight, and puts a lot of effort into her exercise. She completes daily morning jogging, attends as many dance lessons as she can do, and constantly counts her calories. Despite this, she is terrified when she thinks that she can’t fit herself into a costume and worries it may be due to the fact that she rarely drinks after work. In the end, it turned out that Chihiro Sengawa mixed her dress up with another idol’s. She seems to like to use Helen’s “worldwide” gimmick when she’s around and is a decent golf player."
Tomoka Wakabayashi,"cheerful, energetic","Tomoka is a cheerful cheerleader who enjoys lifting other people's spirits. She is as energetic as one might imagine, and she's always full of cheer. She enjoys being a source of happiness and believes it to be a truly special power that she has. She always sports a long, single ponytail.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Tomoka is a friendly cheerleader with endless energy. She is very diligent in her lessons, and takes her cheers very seriously. Her devotion for cheering not only goes to her performances, but to cheering as an audience member for her fellow idols’ events as well. She seems to be friends with Chieri Ogata and Rumi Wakui, and likes the muffler Mayu Sakuma gave the Producer. She later went to go cheer on Yoko Saito and Itsuki Manabe with Risa Matoba and Yuu Ohta. Tomoka’s cheerfulness carries over into her art style, proving she can draw cute cats with ketchup."
Miu Yaguchi,"Bright, Earnest","Miu aimed to be an idol after going to a live performance left her moved and inspired. A bright and earnest girl who loves her friends, Miu is very popular and has confidence in her ability to make people laugh.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Miu is a reserved but fun loving girl. While she can easily play serious roles, she seems to have trouble with comedic jobs and telling jokes. She has a talent for making chocolate. Miu decided to trade school uniforms with Yao Fueifuei, Riina Tada, and Karen Hojo and was thrilled when Karen chose hers to wear. She initially seemed to have trouble finding her image as an idol, as she found it hard to decide on costumes and their implications on her image. Miu is one of the ogling victims of Atsumi Munakata and left an impact on Syoko Hoshi over Valentine’s Day chocolate. She tried to scare her friends while pretending to be a shark underwater, but didn’t convince anyone when they realized she was in a river."
Anna Mochizuki,"Shy, Withdrawn","Anna is 14-year-old girl who always seems tired. In normal speech, she uses a lot of ""..."" and acts very withdrawn and slightly mature, and her only interests seeming to be games and singing. She is friends with Yuriko both online and in person, and games under the name ""vivid_rabbit"". Even when she's not near a computer, she's sure to be playing games on her cellphone. You'd expect her to be the kind of idol who complains about working and being pulled away from her lifestyle, but surprisingly, she's not.

When she gets into her idol activities or changes into her idol outfit, she changes spectacularly. She 'switches' into a super-energetic, passionate idol who gives it every ounce of strength she has, often saying ""bibi~"" to fire herself and others up. She's persistent and a hard worker-- for example, during the outdoor music festival event, she practiced really hard to learn bass so she could be on the same level as the rocker Julia. Her only real weakness is that she's kind of a bad actress and can't really do anything other than the ""energetic type"". However, she actually forces her self to act like that. She's still just the same shy girl on the inside and she works hard on researching how to act energetic, so that she can become as close as possible to her ideal of a great idol."
Umi Kousaka,"Energetic, Confident","The hyperactive girl of the MILLION STARS, Umi is a an athletic girl who excels at almost every sport, and most of her cards depict her doing various sports. She has a very energetic personality to the point that she cannot stand being inactive. Umi can’t calm down when she's not doing anything-- in fact, she once said that when she remembers that there are other idols out there who are working their hardest, her body is unable to rest.

Umi is not only good with active sports like football or basketball; she is also good with gymnastics, and she took ballet lessons when she was younger. All of this made her body very flexible. While she is a sporty girl, she's definitely not a tomboy and she's happy to wear cute dresses. While Umi has great confidence in her legs, she lacks confidence in the upper half of her body and she's not good with makeup."
Karen Shinomiya,"shy, low self-esteem","Though she might give off the aura of someone who's confident in themselves, Karen is actually a shy and reserved girl. The reason she dresses in a flashy way is because she thinks if she dresses in such a way she’ll become less shy, which evidently hasn't worked so far. She also has low self-esteem, always referring herself as simple and having nothing that stands out.

The reason she became an idol is similar to Yukiho in that she wants to change herself, but Karen also wants to become a role model for girls that have similar problems; to be proof that those who have low self-esteem might change themselves for the better. In short, she's a cowardly lion type (which she actually plays as a role she had in the event “Idol School Culture Festival”)."
Haru Estia,"gentle, guilty","Haru Estia is a girl who uses the feeling of helplessness from not being able to do anything as her medium. She is a gentle, huge-sword wielding girl who suffers from feelings of obligation and guilt.

Being the only jack-of-all-trades swordswoman in the character roster, Haru is able to attack her enemies relentlessly with great power in a wide area while still keeping her SG full and available for a short time."
Area,"intelligent, resourceful","Area is a genius teenager, daughter of a scientific inventor, whose inventions she has modified into weapons for her own use.

Rin Kusakabe,"shy, reserved","Rin Kusakabe (日下部綸, Kusakabe Rin) is a Burst Linker. She is a unique Burst Linker and also a member of the Green Legion, Great Wall. Her very shy and reserved character is a complete opposite of her personality in Brain Burst."
Washimi,"assertive, dominant","A secretary bird who is well known around the office for her power. When it comes to women in the company, she's considered at the ""top of the food chain""."
Shiko Kotobuki,"childlike, caring","C-ko Kotobuki is A-ko's best friend and has depended on her since they met in kindergarten. C-ko can be considered quite childlike. She is described as ""cute"" and innocent, tends to be hyperactive, and, in the Japanese version, frequently refers to herself in the third person. C-ko can often be sensitive and immature, and because of this, she has a tendency to cry. Sometimes she can also be selfish and possessive, particularly in regards to A-ko, though whether this is because of unvoiced romantic interest in her friend is unknown. Nevertheless, she is generally a nice, caring, and trusting person, especially towards her friend A-ko, and she usually means well. In the first installment of the series, C-ko is revealed to be the Fourth Princess of the Fifth Queen of the Lepton Kingdom of Alpha Cygni, an all-female race of extraterrestrial aliens. She crash-landed on Earth when she was an infant, and the Lepton Kingdom has been searching fervently for her ever since. However, C-ko is fairly uninterested in her unearthly ancestry and wants nothing more than to remain on Earth with A-ko. C-ko enjoys cooking, but the food that she prepares is largely inedible and often contains ingredients not meant for human consumption. In episode three and four of the main series, we see her having trouble sleeping, usually falling off of the bed after tossing and turning."
Pepperoni,"extroverted, careless","Pepperoni is a student from Anzio Girls High School and, together with Carpaccio, she serves as the Sensha-dō team's vice-commander. She operates a Carro Veloce CV.33.
Pepperoni is an extrovert and easy-going girl, who has a tendency of being rash and not thinking things through. While her cheerful personality makes her an excellent companion, her carelessness about her school's secret weapon allowed Yukari to directly guess what it was; also, during the battle she placed all the decoys (even though two were supposed to be spares, and their presence led to Ooarai sniffing the trap), while ironically remarking that battles aren't won by strength alone but also by intelligence.

However, his stoic demeanor can irritate his companions since he responds to their thoughts with sighs or grunts. By his own admission, Jin has spent most of his time focusing on improving his skills and almost no time at all on cultivating friends. This lack of companionship means that he values Fuu's and Mugen's friendship, and seems genuinely saddened when the three part ways. Although the two annoy him on occasion, he is often willing to take on an extremely deadly opponent alone in order to allow them to escape.

Jin also seems annoyed by those who use their martial arts skills to oppress people, especially those who proclaim that they are doing it in service of their lord.

She then appeared as a playable character of Hopeless Masquerade, she was a 6th and 8th Day Boss of Impossible Spell Card and a Playable Character in Urban Legend in Limbo and Antinomy of Common Flowers. She is a recurring character in Forbidden Scrollery.

She is a bake-danuki of proper lineage, and a youkai of the Outside World who has been called over by Nue Houjuu (by her own judgement) as a means of resistance since the Saint who sings of youkai extermination, Toyosatomimi no Miko, revived. After the quarrel, she started living in the Myouren Temple. She was originally from Sado along with the humans there, and before the events of Ten Desires' Extra stage, passed through the Great Hakurei Barrier to enter Gensokyo. 

Mamizou, proud of her race's esteem, is good natured, albeit with a mischievous streak. She speaks the way an old lady might, and occasionally squints as if she was nearsighted. She isn't one to take a grudge, but as Marisa Kirisame in her extra stage shows she has her limits of niceness. She does enjoy pulling pranks on humans and watching them be confused and flustered. Perhaps because in the latter half of Ten Desires, there were many characters who engage in things while they actually had ulterior motives, in one part, it can be said ""Mamizou is the conscience of this game."" In the game, she talked in a light friendly way, and because the way she spoke indicated ""training"", it seems that she currently is very confident in her power as a youkai.

Her first person pronoun is ""washi"" (儂), which is entirely an old person's way of speaking. Nevertheless, this seems to be her way of saying things, and not so much because a belief of having aged. Since the bake-danuki who showed up in Oriental Sacred Place also used ""washi"", it might just be that all tanuki use old people's way of speaking.

Despite being brought in as a 'trump card', she is noted as being friendly with humans, and has been seen taking on the form of a human while in the Human Village. According to the omake text of Ten Desires, ""sometimes she'd trick them, but she'd also lend money to the poor and worked diligently on any task she was given, so she integrated well into human society"", showing that she is reliable and kind at heart. Though she is seen in the Human Village often in human form, Symposium of Post-mysticism has stated that she does not make an effort to hide her tail, considering it a mark of her high status.

However, she doesn't get along with kitsune, and in Symposium of Post-mysticism, Mamizou says that Sado is a country entirely of bake-danuki, and not a single fox can be found there. It's said that if she encounters one, there will be trouble."

Hinata's dream is to become strong enough to spike past tall blockers, just like his idol, the Small Giant, once did. However, since he lacks height to play middle blocker effectively, he specializes in jumping to compensate.

Hinata is 164.2 cm, making him the second shortest person on his team, next to Nishinoya (although this height is typically average for a male Japanese High School student and is also seen in grown men). He has unruly, orange hair and brown eyes. His relatively thin build and short stature often lead him to be mistaken for a junior high (or in some cases even grade school) student. Hinata typically dresses in his Karasuno school uniform with a black jacket and black pants. Beneath his jacket is a beige or tan sweatshirt. In the first episode, he wore the green volleyball uniform from his junior high.

During matches, Hinata wears his volleyball uniform—a navy blue jersey and corresponding shorts with white and orange stripes on the sides. On the back of his jersey is his position number 10 (coincidentally, the same number that was worn by the Small Giant) and his school's name written in kanji. On the court, he wears kneepads and white volleyball shoes with red stripes.

Hinata has a cheerful and energetic personality. He is easily excited and can be quite loud, a trait second only to Nishinoya and Tanaka. For the most part, Hinata is very simple-minded which sometimes cause him to make rash decisions. However, he is also shown to be quite observant. He is capable of reading social cues and be incredibly empathetic toward others' struggles. As such, he often says just what others need to hear to push themselves in the right direction. He is also noted to be a natural schmoozer, a quality that his teammates occasionally use to win someone over (Nishinoya, for example). His friendly and straightforward personality allows him to befriend even the quietest of people effortlessly, such as Kenma from Nekoma High and Aone from Date Tech High.

However, despite his generally bubbly exterior, Hinata is also shown to have a serious attitude, particularly when it comes to volleyball. His intense love for the sport is demonstrated through his impressive display of tenacity stemming from his constant desire to improve his abilities. As stated by Sugawara, Hinata plays with great fortitude in the face of adversity and thus doesn't give up easily during a match. Hinata can also exhibit a very intimidating expression when people underestimate him. Still, Hinata gets scared easily, especially by larger and stronger opponents. This prompts him to develop the habit of hiding behind his nearest teammate. However, he recovers quickly before confidently challenging their opponents.

In the beginning, Hinata is easily agitated before a match due to his lack of experience. He becomes so nervous that he would have an upset stomach or need to go to the toilet constantly. He also becomes clumsy as he would mess up his spikes or receives.

Hinata, like Kageyama, does poorly in school since he, too, is preoccupied with volleyball. He once told Sugawara that ever since he'd entered high school, he had never scored in the double digits on any of his tests."
Kageyama Tobio,"Arrogant, Sensitive","Tobio Kageyama is a first-year at Karasuno High School; he is the regular setter of the Karasuno High Boys' Volleyball Club and plays a critical role as the deuteragonist of the Haikyū!! series. Initially, he was referred to as the ""King of the Court,"" a derogatory nickname that insinuates his autocratic nature, given to him by his former teammates at Kitagawa Daiichi during his late junior-high days. Kageyama is also widely regarded as a stunning prodigy and an absolute genius by many of the prefecture's players and coaches. After joining Karasuno, he manages to change his attitude for the better with the help of his new teammates and 'rediscover' what it means to be a part of a team.

Kageyama's height and impressively sharp glare are said to be his most prominent physical characteristics. He is of a muscular build. He often emits an intimidating aura, which is heightened by the almost permanent scowl on his face. His black hair is cropped short, with a fringe that hangs just above his dark blue eyes. His typical attire consists of either his school uniform or practice clothes.

Perpetually sullen, arrogant, and undeniably short-tempered, Kageyama originally came off as a typical overbearing perfectionist, caring only about winning and completely disregarding the opinions and well-being of his teammates. His habit of complaining about their performance and barking orders at them eventually led the other players in Kitagawa Daiichi to nickname him the ""King of the Court"", a constant reminder of the oppressive, egocentric attitude he demonstrated during his volleyball career in junior high.

Unbeknownst to the majority of his schoolmates and acquaintances, however, he is actually much more sensitive and childish than he appears to be; he simply does not know how to control his frustration, and hence expresses his thoughts and emotions in an inappropriate way.

After everyone in Kitagawa Daiichi became fed up with him and abandoned his side, Kageyama was filled with genuine regret and developed an intense fear of being despised and mistrusted, but refused to openly discuss his problem until Tsukishima confronted him about it.

Despite his inability to properly socialize, he sincerely wishes to do his best and is extremely passionate and dedicated when it comes to volleyball, to the point where he gets overly excited about nearly every successful move he pulls off with Hinata.

Since joining Karasuno, he has grown to be more respectful of his upperclassmen (Sugawara and Asahi in particular), as well as more accepting of people whose abilities and/or views differ from his own (like Tsukishima), and has come to once again understand the importance of teamwork and mutual trust in the sport he treasures so much. Additionally, this has also helped him regain his confidence as a setter."

Tatsumi is a loud and eccentric idol producer who has big ambitions for ""saving"" the Saga prefecture with his zombie idol. He is unwavering and passionate when it comes to achieving this goal, doing whatever it takes to make the girls into a sensational idol group.

Though he may have lofty motivations, however, Tatsumi himself seems to be quite an idiot and often pretends to be more knowledgeable than he actually is. When his ignorance is ever revealed, he often resorts to lashing out and yelling at whoever called him out. He rarely ever takes into account the girls' feelings about his ill-conceived and unreasonable plans, such as forcing Sakura to perform in front of a crowd of death metal fans when she explicitly told him that she couldn't.

Despite his flaws, Tatsumi does seem to have some semblance of wisdom and understanding, telling off Ai and Junko for giving up on the idol group so easily, which would eventually help convince them to join the group."

In Shinkyoku Soukai Polyphonica Crimson S, she has eight wings and is called 'Crimson Queen'.

She appears to lack any common sense at first, shown by almost walking off the cliff while chasing a butterfly. Due to her amnesia, Sophie has only basic knowledge of communication, and knows little of anything else, especially emotions; however, as the story progresses, she develops strong bonds with everyone she meets, fueled by her desire to protect those important to her, a trait learned from Asbel. She is often left confused at the more complicated discussions that the party has, and takes many things too seriously.

Ada Vessalius,"caring, strong","Ada Vessalius(エイダベザリウス / Eida Bezariusu sometimes romanized as Ada Bezarius) is a member of the Vessalius Dukedom born to Xai Vessalius and Rachel Cecile who is also currently acting as a student attending Lutwidge Academy. After Oz was cast into the Abyss during his Coming of Age Ceremony, Ada was desperate to get back the elder brother who she had always looked up to, going so far as to take up the occult in hopes of finding a way to rescue Oz. Though Ada was unsuccessful, Oz managed to escape on his own, and so Ada was reunited at last with her long lost brother. Since Oz's release, Ada has been dating Vincent Nightray, unaware that he'd been using her so that he could one day steal the Vessalius Key from her uncle, Oscar Vessalius. However, the more time Vincent spends with Ada, the more he grows to care for her, which is significantly most prominent during Isla Yura's Feast.

Since then, Ada has learned from her father than Oz is actually the fearsome Chain, B-Rabbit, and has been dormant within Jack Vessalius' body for more than 100 years. Though Ada now knows that her true brother died long before she was even born, Ada refuses to shun Oz as her father does. Unfortunately, when Xai leaves Ada in the care of the Baskerville Clan, Noise intervenes and knocks Ada unconscious, kidnapping her in order to use her as a bargaining chip. When Noise is successful, she drags Ada to Sablier to be killed in front of Vincent so that Noise can show him that Ada isn't like the Baskervilles and so Vincent should give up on her. Fortunately, Ada is saved by Oz before Noise can achieve her goals, joining Oz, Alice and Gilbert Nightray as they journey into the past to save the world. Here, though Ada's influence is weak, she manages to get through to Vincent and draw him off of his self loathing that was leading to his destruction, thereby saving the man she's grown to love.True to her genetics, Ada has long flowing golden-blonde hair that drapes over the tops of her shoulders and dazzling emerald green eyes. As a child prior to Oz's drop into the Abyss, Ada wore a dainty pink dress with a slightly frilled three-button collar, two small bows tied in the center at the front and leading down to bell-shaped sleeves. Over top of her dress, Ada would also wear a small green coat hemmed with frilled arrangements and gold outlining, which covered only as much as half of Ada's upper arms before her dress sleeves poked through.

Since Oz's drop into the Abyss, Ada has been attending Lutwidge Academy, and so she most often wears the minatory uniform that all female students have to wear: a white undershirt, a black vest adorned with a bow, a white overcoat, a short white skirt, white leggings and black shoes. However, whenever she's on break from Lutwidge, Ada takes to wearing a pale green colored dress adorned with a bow and that has a stripe pattern along the center at the front of the dress going as far as Ada's waist and appears to be duplicated on the sleeves of the dress.. The dress also appears to be tied around Ada's waist with a bow, flowing down off of her rather elegantly.Most often, Ada appears to be rather fragile by nature and devotes her time to those she cares about most: her friendship and familiars. Ada treasures her family above all else, especially Oz, who she'd always looked up to while growing up as her elder brother; even taking up the occult in order to try and unearth a means of saving Oz after he'd been dropped into the Abyss. Though she was relieved when Oz escaped the Abyss, Ada's period of reprieve seemed rather short lived as mere months later she learned that Oz wasn't in fact her true brother. Even so, Ada refused to deny Oz as her brother, not caring about what Oz really is because he's still her brother as far as she's concerned, showing how pure Ada's relationship is with those she considers to be family.

Ada has since been dating Vincent Nightray, growing to love and accept him for who he is no matter what happens; as shown when she still attempts to protect Vincent during Isla Yura's Feast after he'd pushed her away in fear. Over time, Ada's connection to Vincent has be the source of her growing strength, as she eventually stood strong against Noise when she continuously attempted to kill her in order to make a point to Vincent. Afterwards, Ada even approached Vincent and Demios the Executioner when Vincent's mind started to collapse; braving Demios' attacks and even attempt at decapitating Ada just so that she could console Vincent and show him that he had a reason to continue living. In short, Ada's loving and caring personality has shown those around the light that they required to keep fighting for what's right, and with them Ada has grown into a strong and confident young woman."

Inga,"Bubbly, Loyal","Inga, a mysterious boy who follows Shinjūrō. It seems that he and Shinjūrō are tied together by a curious bond. Inga is usually protected by Shinjūrō, but when a crisis is at hand, the roles are reversed. When the time comes, Inga can turn into a mature woman and help Shinjuro solve cases. Inga appears to be a young boy between the ages of 13 - 14. He has a small stature (155 cm) and very pale skin. This and the fact that his eyes are usually tinted light yellow, makes him appear very sickly. His slightly curly hair is a purple-ish grey. His hair is also very long and it normally covers his right eye. When his hair is lifted, it is revealed that he has a black mark over his right eye, that can be fully seen when he transforms in his adult form.

He wears black cargo pants that are cut up to his knees. On Inga's right leg, the skin is jet black, but many people mistake this for a sock. The same with his left hand. It isn't a glove, it is his skin. Inga wears a light pink shirt, with a black waistcoat over it. The sleeves of the shirt are rolled up to his elbows. He has a white, fluffy hat on his head that resembles a panda. Two black, long mittens are connected to the hat by strings and Inga is often seen wearing them.

She wears red and black pants, but with only one red ""sleeve"". Inga has a very bubbly personality. He is always active and child-like, sometimes even naïve. He is very loyal to Shinjūrō and has an affectionate relationship with him. He admires Shinjūrō and calls him ""The Last Great Detective"". Inga is always hungry after the truth and wants to know the whole story as soon as possible. This is also why he sometimes ""can't hold it any longer"". This means that he is eager to tranform into his female, adult form, use his ability and find out the truth. When he and Shinjūrō get closer to the truth, he gets overly excited.
Inga in his female form, has a slightly different personality. When Inga transforms, she becomes more flirty, but also more sadistic. She has a temper and sometimes resorts to violence. She is also way more cool-headed than the normal Inga, and even manipulative."

Evermillion, when released from inside of Honoka, takes the appearance of an extremely tall, humanoid woman. Her ears are very odd, being long and pointed like those of an elf.

Her nails are also extremely long. In ancient history, in many cultures; this was a sign of great power. To have long nails like this, was a sign of the ability to have much spare time, meaning no work was performed by this person which might endanger his/her nails. Nails normally break, if used for their intended purpose, hence leisure and idle time.

She wears an extremely extravagant ballroom gown and has a small, cartoon-ish crown on her head.

Nearly every inch of her is white with a pinkish hue, including her hair, skin, and gown. The only exceptions are her red eyes and blue earrings. Evermillion is very playful and easy-going. Even when facing off against Medusa she kept a very casual demeanor and then immediately engaged in a conversation with Honoka even as what little was left of Kazane Kagari's mansion was threatening to collapse.

She likes to tease others, such as calling Honoka ""Honoka-kyun"" and then claiming he had to give up his eyes to remove the petrification from Ayaka (though she was playfully fibbing).

She does have some concern for Honoka, saying he should avoid summoning her too often. One gets the feeling it is because, no resource is endless. She is probably concerned that too much of her may be drained too quickly to be of use, if she has to simultaneously fight the seals and produce power too often; her own existence might become at risk."
Chizuru Yoshida,"Tomboy, Emotional","Chizuru Yoshida is another close friend of Sawako and Ayane Yano. She is the tomboy of the group, and she even admits this when Ryu calls them brothers, where she rather argues about who is the oldest rather than that she is not a 'brother'.

She was called again when the Sisters were being used for the Level 6 Shift program. However, when she noticed the Sisters had something of a conscience, she was unable to see them as objects. She attempted to stop the experiments by using envelopes containing cash cards to fill the unwatched alleyways they are held with human eyes. She does not appear to have any powers, but uses good acting to invoke fear into enemies and make them believe she has a deadly one.

Natsumi Hinata,"kind, athletic","The older sister of Fuyuki Hinata, Natsumi is a kind, tomboyish, athletic, popular. teenager whose most notable points are her great athletic abilities and her bitter rivalry with the series' antihero, Sergeant Keroro. As her mother, Aki, is mostly at work, Natsumi often takes care of the house chores. She always calls Keroro

""bokegaeru"" (ボケガエル stupid frog) . In her mother's absence, Natsumi tends to adopt the role of providing the ""voice of reason"" to maintain order around the house--although with the circus the house has become with the help from its alien guests, she usually has to resort to beating up on the platoon to set them straight. Unbeknownst to her, she has an additional ability to foil Corporal Giroro, as he is in love with her and will occasionally abandon wicked schemes, even in defiance of his allies, if harm might come to her as a result of the them. Despite sometimes seeming cold and impersonal, she deeply cares about her family, and, although she rarely admits it, her surrogate alien ""family,"" and desperately wishes for her mother to spend some quality time with her and Fuyuki. Within her family, Natsumi is probably the only one capable of noticing the presence of the house spirit. Whenever the spirit causes mischief or makes an appearance, Natsumi immediately feels under the weather due to the ghost's spiritual presence.

During her grade-school days in the manga, Natsumi was nicknamed ""Devil Summer"" (her name literally means ""summer beauty"") due to her violent temper, though she became more mature when she reached middle school. In the original anime, she followed an opposite route. She was initially a crybaby, but became stronger as she grew up. Although generally tomboyish for her athleticism, Natsumi has a number of typical ""teenage girl"" insecurities, especially around her crush, Saburo. She is an avid listener to 623's radio show, though her failure in ever listening to any of her postcards over the show has become a running gag in the series. She also likes sweets and snacks, as well as flowers and cute things.

Natsumi is initially extremely popular among the alumni at her school, especially due to excelling in all kinds of sports. She's often sought by various clubs to help, and often has all girls around her cheering for her, like a school idol. One of her most notable admirers is Koyuki Azumaya. However, this popularity seems to be downplayed in later stories of both manga and anime. She still seems to be liked by the other students in general, but not with the level of fanaticism initially shown. Her athletic abilities and participation in various clubs also are comparatively downplayed, although she remains known as a talented athlete.

At times, Natsumi and Keroro seem to absolutely hate each other, as Keroro is an idiotic annoyance to her once-peaceful life and as she herself is Keroro's main obstacle from world invasion. However, their relationship is one of the most complex within the series, as it varies from rivalry and hate to concern and understanding.

Natsumi has the word 'summer' on her bedroom door, and is part of the kaito team 'MorePeachSummerSnow'. She's also known to have a horrible temper during the summer season. Under the higher heat, she gets easily agitated."

Despite sometimes being called Virgin Queen, whether or not she really is a virgin is a delicate subject. Among her interests is meeting different people, and she doesn’t mind going out to meet them herself. She is also interested in Lute. Having knowledge of martial arts, she goes as far as challenging him, but she is not fond of wars.

Hiromi Seki,"Insecure, Responsible","Hiromi, when first scouted, lacks confidence in herself and her ability to be an idol due to her eyes and her resting face often being interpreted as angry or aggressive. She has difficulty smiling naturally, and carries a hand mirror to secretly practice her expressions with. With the player's support, she is able to work through these insecurities and stand on stage with a dazzling smile.

Many of Hiromi's cards feature skillfully-made accessories, implied or stated outright to be handmade. In several Cinderella Girls Theater comics, she is shown taking inspiration from encounters with other idols to make accessories.

Despite being young, Hiromi is fairly responsible, and takes her work as an idol seriously. If left without supervision, she takes initiative, practicing on her own and pushing her fellow idols to work harder. She is protective of younger idols, and tends to defer to her elders for advice when possible, which has led to her to imitate other idols with sometimes disastrous results."
Setsuna Imura,"creative, nurturing","Setsuna is a teenager who loves make-up and experimenting with it. Initially released as the boss of the 2012 Starry Night Christmas event, Setsuna carries an odd stuffed animal everywhere, even more than plush-lover Miyuki Yanase.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Setsuna shows that she takes her makeup very seriously. Like many other idols whose personas change when wearing something different onstage, Setsuna feels like her makeup gives her the ability to continue as an idol. She doesn’t know much about the Halloween holiday, but when Tomo Fujii tricks her, she acts much like an older sibling over Tomo now being unable to have the cake Setsuna made. She doesn’t like snakes."
Yuu Ohta,"competitive, airheaded","Yuu is a young woman with a flair for the extravagant who owns a long-suffering purse dog Akky, who appears to be a Bichon Frise.

Yuu doesn’t have much common sense but has a competitive nature, and as a result it gets Akky into unfortunate hijinks. Yuu has a beauty mark on her right breast.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Yuu is shown to be a proud and competitive young woman, although she is rather airheaded and doesn’t have much common sense. She loves her dog Akky and enjoys getting him involved with her idol work. She has dressed the dog up in a bunny suit, in traditional garb, and used a feather duster. Akky himself has also been attempted to be used as a pompom on several occasions by both Risa Matoba and Tokiko Zaizen. The other idols know that she loves the dog, but can’t help but worry when Yuu brings a chocolate statue of him to the office.

While Akky's often depicted struggling to escape Yuu's grasp, she really doesn't do any true harm. He's perfectly content and happy in her New Year SR, showing they do have a good relationship when Yuu isn't laying the affection on too thick. In fact, most of the things Akky suffers occur because someone claims he isn't cute or fluffy enough for something, which leads his master into making him impossibly cuter and fluffier. Sometimes an idol will jokingly comment that Yuu should do something ridiculous with Akky. For example: dress him in a matching costume so he can perform on stage with her. In reality the idol is just being silly and doesn't expect it to actually happen. However Yuu has no common sense when it comes to these things, so Akky will have a horrified expression when those statements are given because it will happen.

While Akky is not able to talk aloud, sometimes the Cinderella Girls Theater reveals what he's thinking. He generally has more common sense than Yuu. He is aware the things Yuu does to him are insane, but knows she would become completely heartbroken if he permanently ran away."
Kurumi Ohnuma,"Sensitive, Insecure","Kurumi is an overly sensitive girl with tremendously low self-esteem who easily and visibly cries often. Her crying expression appears to be her default appearance for most situations. In fact, her entire range of emotions includes being teary eyed. Her hobby of collecting tissue packs stems from her habit of biting handkerchiefs. When she is happy or upset, she often cries into the Producer’s chest.

Kurumi finds her large body measurements to be disappointing, and complains about her bust size occasionally. She is a frequent victim of groping from her fellow idols, the most common offender being Atsumi Munakata.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Kurumi is introduced by Shiho Makihara. She seems to always be on the verge of tears, and will always manage to get tangled up in a jump rope by accident. Her habit of getting tied up in jump ropes is viewed as an amazing skill."
Kotoka Saionji,"Polite, Respectful","Kotoka is an incredibly polite young woman who gives the Producer an extraordinary degree of respect, as if he was worthy of genuflection. She is aware of the Producer's success as an idol promoter and holds the utmost respect for him. He's called Producer-sama by her. Kotoka speaks very formally, especially when it’s towards the Producer. Aside from her extremely polite way of talking, she never showed signs of her wealthy upbringing. It was revealed in later cards that Kotoka is astonishingly wealthy, to the point that she considered a palace sized mansion to be quaint.

In Starlight Stage, it was confirmed that she is very wealthy; as her family are the owners of a very important business (the Saionji Group), and she was sent directly to the Producer by her father. Although she considered herself very inexperienced in life, she promised to work hard and give it her all to be a good idol. Kotoka appears very formal and kind to the Producer, but he told her to be more casual and less stiff; which she happily agreed to. It was also revealed that she does extra practice to improve her skills when she feels she hasn't performed well enough during her lessons.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Kotoka is viewed as the princess type by other idols. Somewhat of an airhead and utterly playful, she tends to get herself into dangerous situations. She knows absolutely nothing about cooking. When the Producer walks her to her mansion, she admits that he opened up entire worlds for her as an idol."
Seika Suzumiya,"gentle, supportive","Seika is a gentle violin player who accepts being an idol. She has very refined speech, calling her Producer ""-sama"" and using ""Watakushi"" for herself. She wears simple yet elegant dresses, and notably switches between loose hair, two pigtails and a single ponytail.

In more recent cards, she went from being a sweet classical music-themed idol to being featured in darker kinds of events such as Devil Girls and taking part in the band gacha, where she plays bass.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Seika is shown to be like an older sister to many of the younger idols. She gives advice to the girls on how to emphasize their positive points. She has recently been seen performing in a band with Riina Tada, Kiyomi Saejima, and Layla. She likes to put her hair in pigtails, and enjoys picking out cheap snacks."
Kiyora Yanagi,"friendly, mature","Kiyora is a registered medical nurse with a coy sense of humor. When she treated the Producer in the past, she playfully toyed with the needles seen on her cards. It quickly became clear that she fell for him while he was under her care.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Kiyora is shown to be a friendly and mature woman who acts as a mentor for other idols. Originally a nurse, her mentality to help others transferred to her job as an idol. She loves making the audience smile, and earnestly wants to be a support member as an idol. She doesn’t like being the center of attention, but still wants to live up to the Producer’s expectations. She seems to have accidental ulterior motives as an idol, namely being that she wants to help the Producer become “Top Producer”. Kiyora has an occasional dark streak which appears when angered or annoyed. She has fun in a Dream Festival event with Aoi Shuto, Hajime Fujiwara, and Kumiko Matsuyama where she had to go fishing (proving she was bad with worms) and cook. She is shown to be friends with Sanae Katagiri and a good snowboarder."
Helen,"Confident, Strong","Helen is a woman from across the seas, though she is mysteriously secretive of which nation she's a native from. While she has a last name, she refuses to reveal it. Her idol cards focus on non-Japanese fashions. She is generally depicted as a strong woman who is confident and mature, and very self-assured of her abilities.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Helen is constantly saying that she is a “world-class” idol, and will often compare things to this for emphasis. She has been known to have a very brazen sense of style and was one of the idols targeted by Atsumi Munakata for her bust. However, instead of not allowing her to touch, Helen gave her permission on the condition of massaging her legs and feet. Helen has been depicted as an amazing dancer, although her routines are sometimes viewed by her as simple towel rubdowns."
Shino Hiiragi,"Fun-loving, carefree","At 31, Shino isn't exactly at a common age for idols. Nevertheless, she becomes an idol because it seems interesting. Shino has a love of alcohol- namely wine- and often drinks openly in front of the Producer. She stays calm and composed when drunk. She has been drunk while performing on stage and is at her best when doing so. She is almost always seen with a bottle or glass, and it is rumored that she is only sober when sleeping. Her favorite color is purple, and she considers her back to be her best feature.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Shino is almost always seen with some form of alcohol. Her first appearance showed her performing well onstage while sipping wine and she has since been found to be at her best when intoxicated. She is a good drinking friend of Kaede Takagaki, and several other idols point out her habit of always being drunk."
Megumi Ijuin,"loner, voice of reason","In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Megumi has been shown as being a loner and seems to be very fond of beer. She enjoys looking at landscapes by herself, and acts as a voice of reason for some of the teenaged idols."
Chinami Komuro,"refined, caring","Chinami is the boss of the Yokoyama area. She is a refined and diva-like young woman who aims for the top of idol business. While she was initially depicted as a self-absorbed and haughty, she has since become much more caring towards her fellow idols.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Chinami is ready to take advantage of a romantic atmosphere. Unfortunately, she is commonly interrupted from telling the Producer her true feelings and gets annoyed as it happens more often. She does however help the other girls, like Kiyomi Saejima and Kumiko Matsuyama, state their feelings for the Producer. She has found a rival in Kiyomi, mostly due to the fact that Chinami was rebellious in her high school years. She admittedly broke the rules concerning hair and skirt length, and even occasionally left to go play darts. She prides herself in her artistic sense."
Chiaki Kurokawa,"Serious, Ambitious","Chiaki is a very serious and mature young woman. In her initial cards she acts very aloof and serious, but starts being a bit more cheerful after meeting Misato Manaka in the Pajama Party event. Chiaki comments that Misato’s cheerfulness managed to move her, and the two wound up being friends.

It was revealed in Starlight Stage that Chiaki became an idol purely to aim for the top. As she heard that idols aren't limited to singing, dancing, or acting, and can take different jobs; she decided to become an idol to surpass her own limits.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, she can be seen attending the Pajama Party with Misato and notes that everyone else attending is very young compared to them. While staying at a hotel for an off-site job, Mahiro Kitagawa points out that Chiaki’s nightdress is in a much more mature style than the cutesy pajamas she wore to the Pajama Party. Chiaki says that it’s important for idols to wear things that suit them, causing Mahiro to laugh as she says that she’s choosing a style Producer likes. Chiaki is quick to deny this. Depicted as quick on her feet, she makes a quick save when both Miyabi Tsukimiya and Misaki Etou drop trays of food at an event. She is a good swimmer. Chiaki’s dream role is that of the daughter of a noble family, clad in a regal dress, or a slightly greedy queen."
Layla,"Mysterious, Curious","Layla is a mysterious girl with a vivid eyes and an intense stare. She spends her free time wandering parks and fields, approaching people at random and stirring up unusual conversations. Layla is confirmed to not be Japanese, but her ethnicity is currently still unrevealed, although she is from Dubai. Her eyes are notable for having constricted pupils and a vivid light blue hue, which comes across like a dead soulless stare. Her contrasting dark skin and blond hair only add to the mystery of her country of origin.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Layla is introduced by Ayaka Kishibe. She speaks with incorrect grammar, and mentions that she came to Japan because “something happened”. She asks for tons of money as her New Year’s wish, and doesn’t seems to understand many of Japan’s customs. When the other idols are coming up with ways to sneak Christmas presents to one another, she believes that Japan actually has many Santas."
Hijiri Mochizuki,"Romantic, Friendly","Hijiri is often considered to be the Cool type counterpart to Eve Santaclaus, as well as being a fellow Christmas themed idol who typically receives new cards during the winter holiday season. Whereas Eve is associated with the gift giving and Santa Claus appeal of Christmas, Hijiri is associated to its romantic and snowy night aspect. She is also notable for breaking the ""no two idols share a birthdate"" rule, as Shino Hiiragi was the first to have December 25th. She loves Christmas carols and snow, and is shown to be very conservative in her idol clothes when compared to other idols. She has been known to comment about romantic snowy nights, and spending them with the Producer.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Hijiri admits that she has never baked before. She attempts to make cookies with Kaoru Ryuzaki, but constantly churns out burned batches. However, she does quickly befriend the younger idol. Hijiri is thoroughly amazed when Chinatsu Aikawa gives her a cake with a sugar figurine that resembles her, and has a hard time dealing with eating the creation."
Yukimi Sajo,"Quiet, Mysterious","Yukimi is a quiet and mysterious girl with a very slow speaking style who is often with her pet cat, Pero. She made a binding promise with the Producer, of which little has been revealed about. Yukimi refers to the promise she made with the Producer by using terms such as ""will last forever,"" ""do not break it,"" and ""never forget"". Yukimi also has a quiet laugh that goes ""fufu"" or ""ufufu"", and will suddenly giggle for seemingly no reason. She loves strawberries.

Despite being taciturn and slightly creepy, Yukimi still is a child, and wants to impress the Producer. Starlight Stage reveals that she practices talking to Pero in order to get better at talking to people. It's likely her odd behavior is more of a result of lack of social skill then actually being a yandere.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Yukimi is depicted as being very odd and speaking rather brokenly with many ellipses. She believed Rena Hyodo to be a magician, and sees Tomoe Murakami’s ideas of disciplining men as cool. When the other idols decided to surprise her on Christmas by giving gifts to her, she was shocked to find logs covered in mushrooms from Syoko Hoshi. She isn’t very physically strong. Yukimi is very dedicated to any role she gets, and will often try to convince herself that she is the character she is playing. Her talk battle situation is watching her teacher’s strength filled hand break chalk on the chalkboard when she write, but hers is defeated by Koharu Koga’s story."
Rei Shinohara,"Confidence, Cowardice","Rei is an exceptionally confident and voluptuous dance instructor. She often puts strong emphasis on her impressive cleavage, but can still maintain a professional demeanor. She's deathly afraid of lightning, and her apartment is filled with charms that Japanese children believe ward away rainstorms.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Rei is admittedly a coward who would like to overcome her fear. She is seen as being very good at quizzes and is a drinking friend of Rena Hyodo, Kaede Takagaki, Shino Hiiragi, and Sanae Katagiri."
Reiko Takahashi,"Charming, Insightful","Reiko is an alluring woman who wants to capitalize on her natural sex appeal. She is heavily based on actress and model Chiaki Takahashi, who voices Azusa Miura. They have the same family name, birthdate, blood type, and hometown, and share both similar physical attributes and personality. She is also hinted at being part of a unit with Ai Togo, Aya Kirino, Chiaki Kurokawa, and Chinatsu Aikawa.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Reiko seems to have her eyes on the Producer and his whereabouts. It is apparent that she has great insight on the personalities of other idols and is teased by Mayu Sakuma about her age."
Makino Yagami,"Observant, Mysterious","Makino is an observant and mysterious woman who always seems to know more than she lets on. While she appears to be a genuine spy, it’s unknown who she works for or why she became an idol. She's prone to saying, ""according to my research."" Adding to the mystery, a rumor in Starlight Stage alleges that she's erased all her personal data.

After collecting secret data about the other idols from 346 Production's office network, she discovers a personnel file specifically about her in the system. Players never shown what's in the file, but reading it makes Makino go into shock after losing faith in her own espionage abilities. She mutters about begging the Producer to reveal who the mysterious counterintelligence agent is. It's assumed to most likely be Chihiro Senkawa. Interestingly, the room she’s depicted as having hacked into contains several items and accessories from other idols’ cards, and the information she has discovered contains images of units and individual idols’ information (even Anzu Futaba's measurements, which are not revealed in-game).

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Makino is introduced by Hasumi Nagatomi. Her idol persona is clearly very intelligent, but she can be easily manipulated in a team effort. She takes note of when other idols change their image, and can be seen collecting data on her friends. Makino does much research over her roles, and isn’t afraid of asking for help when she needs it. She tries to recruit Tsubaki Egami for her purposes of corporate espionage."
Misaki Etou,"ambitious, romantic","Dissatisfied with a slow moving corporate career as an office lady, Misaki became an idol to seek new avenues of opportunity. As she develops a crush on the producer, she starts relating herself to the romance novels' heroines she reads.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Misaki is defined by her “girl power”. Girl power to her means being in high fashion, wearing cute accessories, and sometimes going to girlish cafes and shops. She loves sparkly and interesting objects, particularly jewels, although she has been distracted by crabs before. She believes acting is a way to find a new and different personality.

She is impressed by Kotoka Saionji’s airheadedness and is a friend of Miyabi Tsukimiya. Misaki plans to give the Producer chocolates at their Valentine’s Day dinner. One job had her working as a maid, but she dropped her tray in worry over Yukimi Sajo. Thankfully, Chiaki Kurokawa caught it. She is also quick to believe Haruna Kamijou in attempts to put glasses on cats and finds Tomoe Murakami to be a female supremacist rather than a feminine girl. When she works at a wedding event with Ayaka Kishibe, she finds that while wearing a wedding dress will marry late, she plans on sharing the Producer with Ayaka and Miyabi."
Ibuki Komatsu,"carefree, spirited","Ibuki is an amateur dancer recruited by the Producer after he witnessed her impromptu street performance. She is able to perform all sorts of skateboard stunts and keeps her hair in pigtails to make sure they stay intact while dancing.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Ibuki is very carefree and spirited. Normally a fantastic skateboarder, she becomes distracted when thinking of ways to impress the Producer and get closer to him. Her skills are reused when she performs many Frisbee catches while riding around. She is embarrassed when she has to wear a school uniform at an event and seems to not mind when she becomes sunburnt before a live. She also noticed that Takumi Mukai, despite being very passionate about practicing making chocolates, becomes completely flustered at the thought of kissing the Producer.

Ibuki was quick to believe that there was some truth in romantic movies, as they stated that love can start at high-end parties where the leading lady spills her drink on her romantic partner. When she spills her drink on the Producer, she becomes completely flustered and defensive when Kanade Hayami brings up the movie."
Reina Koseki,"malicious, spiteful","Reina is a foul-natured girl who condescends over others. She is a prankster and backstabber, and rarely shows regret for it. She is the closest person to being ""evil"" among the Cinderella Girls characters, although this really means she's just a bit more confrontational than the typical idol. With her boast of ""I am the Queen of Evil!"", she enjoys watching others getting pranked or laughing at their misfortune. She tends to do things for seemingly no reason other than that she enjoys being spiteful. She carries a megaphone everywhere, and always wears a hateful scowl.

Despite her attitude, she avoids pranking idols younger than her and does not intentionally prank anyone to cause physical harm or property damage. Because of this, it's surmised that a lot of her behavior is due to lacking social skills and wanting attention. She has to be coerced into apologizing for her behavior, and never seems to get into serious trouble when caught. She is depicted as having only one or two friends, namely being Sachiko Koshimizu or Hikaru Nanjo.

In the tie in Cinderella Girls Theater skits, Reina is quick to bully and antagonize her fellow idols. She constantly plans ways to hurt the other idols, ranging from simply laughing at others mistakes to launching bazookas at a room full of girls. Some of her bullying attempts include teasing Riina Tada for wearing a cute costume, speeding up Sana Miyoshi’s running machine, scaring Koharu Koga while jump roping, and shooting Yoshino Yorita in the face with a water gun while she was trying to concentrate.

Reina is easily angered and embarrassed, especially if her plans fail. She was tricked by Azuki Momoi into wearing a cute costume and vowed that she would never do it again. Chinatsu Aikawa also forced her to learn that she shouldn’t do things to others if she isn’t willing to take them herself. Reina earned a role in Chika Yokoyama’s magical girl TV show as the Magical Maiden. She is training partners with Sana Miyoshi and Koharu Koga.

Supreme Kai of Time,"friendly, sassy","Chronoa (クロノア Kuronoa), the Supreme Kai of Time (時の界王神 Toki no Kaiōshin, lit. ""Worlds' Kings' God of Time""), is a deity who watches over the flow of time from the cosmos. She is mentioned in Dragon Ball Online as the Lord of Time (界王時間 Kaiōjikan, lit. ""Worlds' King of Time"") and is a major character in the Xenoverse series. 

Chronoa is a short and petite Kaioshin of a youthful and pretty appearance with pinkish-red hair and pink/purple skin. Like most Kaioshin she wears a pair of Potara earrings and robes similar to the worn by the Kaioshin on the Sacred World of the Kai, though it has a more casual design. Her outfit also sports a pair of high heeled boots, which may be to compensate for her short stature, as she is also noticeably shorter than Future Trunks and Goku. Despite her young appearance, she is at least 75 million years old and was alive during the time period when Beerus sealed Old Kai in the Z-Sword, which would make her one of the oldest known living Kaioshin. In Xenoverse 2, Elder Kai reveals that he is about 1,000 years older than her, indicating she is the second oldest Supreme Kai living in Universe 7. 
Despite her role, Chronoa has a friendly, good-natured, if somewhat sassy personality most of the time. Befitting her somewhat childlike appearance, Chronoa can be prone to angry outbursts, like when Tokitoki ruined her introduction to the Future Warrior by perching on her head causing her to angrily yell at the divine bird for sitting on her head and making her look foolish in front of them. She, however, is quite benevolent as she allowed Future Trunks' alterations to remain as she understood Trunks' intentions were noble and ultimately for the greater good. However this did not stop her from deceiving Xeno Trunks into working for her by claiming it was to make up for his sin of using the Time Machine to alter history, when in reality he had actually committed no crime and Chronoa just really needed an assistant, though it is implied that Chronoa didn't think Trunks would take her words as seriously as he did. Chronoa is also shown to think quite highly of herself to the point she believes the meals she cooks are fit for a god, when in reality she is a notoriously horrible cook (it is implied that her poor cooking skills are well known as Whis immediately stopped reaching for a pudding cup when he realized it had been made by her). In fact, her cooking is known to taste awful and give people stomach cramps (capable of putting even the likes of Goku out of action). She, however, is oblivious to this as she mistook Whis' criticism of her cooking (which enraged Beerus to the point that it ironically almost result in another alteration to the history of Age 778), as a compliment and seemed oblivious to the fact that she almost caused another time distortion due to angering Beerus to the point Whis claims that the God of Destruction was capable of extinguishing at least two suns. Chronoa is also a terrible housekeeper as there is a lot of junk around her home in the Time Nest; it is implied that she can be somewhat lazy as she apparently dislikes doing things that require a lot of work, as she is quick to pawn off the task of searching through all the Time Scrolls to find where the wormhole had sent Broly and Bardock to her assistant Xeno Trunks in Xenoverse, left the time rifts in Conton City open as they were mostly stable and eventually decided to just leave them in Conton City permanently after the 2nd Future Warrior recovers all of Towa's Distorted Time Eggs. She also chose to build Conton City on top of the ruins of Toki Toki City instead of rebuilding it after it was destroyed by the Conton City Dragon she accidentally created as it would be a lot faster.

In Xenoverse 2 after an update, due to someone (implied to be Elder Kai) complaining the Expert Mission rifts scattered throughout Conton City were an eyesore, Chronoa decides to merge all the weakened rifts into one big rift which she places near the Time Machine Station to allow the Time Patrol to use the completed Expert Missions for training as a compromise, though she tells the Future Warrior that it would be dangerous to combine any of the rifts that have yet to be weakened so any rifts that have not been weakened will remain in their normal location until its Expert Mission is completed and the rift is weakened, causing it to be merged with the large Expert Mission rift. She chooses to do this instead of simply closing the rifts which are implied would be too much work for her, thus indicating that unless absolutely necessary, she tends to prefer finding solutions or compromises to problems that allow her to avoid less work while at the same time benefiting herself or the Time Patrol, the latter of which she can use to justify said decisions due to it being beneficial to everyone. However, despite these quirks, in her role as the Supreme Kai of Time Chronoa takes threats to history like Demigra and the Time Breakers' seriously, to the point she was quick to remind both Elder Kai and Xeno Trunks that Towa is still a threat after the 2nd Future Warrior prevents Towa from killing Shenron in Age 850. She is also very protective of the Time Nest and Time Vault, as she refuses to allow anyone (even Beerus) to fight near it out of fear it could be damaged or destroyed. She is also shown to be more willing to take action during these times to the point she (with the assistance of Elder Kai) takes on the arduous task of searching through all the Scrolls looking for the source of the massive time distortion caused by Towa killing Shenron in Age 850, while sending Xeno Trunks and the 2nd Future Warrior to check on Conton City. She is also extremely protective of Tokitoki and its eggs, which is one of her duties as Supreme Kai of Time, thus she takes her role very seriously during these situations. Outside of these serious situations, Chronoa is more laid back and will take her time dealing with less serious threats or allow others to take care of it for her while she attends to other matters. Despite her high opinion of her abilities and herself, she does not consider herself to be above everyone as she is friendly to the Time Patrollers that work under her and even accepts a Time Patroller's invitation to have tea together. Despite pawning off tasks to others at times, she is still considerate enough to reward people for their efforts such as Xeno Trunks and the Future Warriors, though unfortunately she often chooses to reward them with food she had cooked, to the point Xeno Trunks convinced her that he preferred convenience store lunches to avoid eating it.

Xeno Trunks attributes her friendly nature to living alone in the Time Nest with only Tokitoki to keep her company in the centuries before the foundation of the Time Patrol. Chronoa is also shown to have a keen interest in technology, often asking Xeno Trunks about various inventions supplied by the Future Capsule Corporation, and has various pieces of technology lying around in the yard in front of her house. Xeno Trunks also reveals that she once caused a cleaning robot to blow a fuse when she asked it too many questions and finds it hard to wait for new stuff she ordered to come in, indicating that her interest in technology can be obsessive at times. She even manages to teach Trunks how to create Time Machines that do not produce alternate timelines, fixing a critical design flaw in his mother's original design, showing that she has a better grasp of time travel technology due to her having a far better understanding of the nature of time than either Xeno Trunks or Future Bulma. Xeno Trunks also states that she will occasionally even suggest ideas to him for new Capsule Corp products. Also despite being the Supreme Kai of Time, Chronoa can be impatient especially when it comes to new technology she ordered, as shown by her exaggerating she's been waiting for 100 years for a new Capsule Corp. product she order to come out and even questions the Future Warrior if they are sure when they tell her that she couldn't have been waiting that long. This is in sharp contrast to her old nemesis Demigra who is known for his extreme patience as he waited 75 million years growing stronger than her. In fact, Chronoa herself admits that she is creeped out by Demigra's extreme persistence.

In Xenoverse 2, she convinces Elder Kai to help out with the Time Patrol as she was busy preparing for Tokitoki to lay its Egg while Trunks and the Future Warrior were busy with locating the Time Breakers who remained at large following Demigra's defeat. While the two are capable of working together, she has a habit of referring to Elder Kai as an old man, despite his insistence that he is only 1000 years older than her (as Shinjin have much longer lifespans) and that his aged appearance is mainly the result of his fusion with the Old Witch. She is occasionally annoyed by Elder Kai's personality and lecherous behavior, as she is quick to taunt and criticize him. During the altered timeline of the Universal Tournament between Universe 6 and 7, Chronoa stated she hopes she never grows old like Elder Kai after he forgets about the written exam despite having been present during the tournament originally, indicating that she is not comfortable with either the prospect or effects of aging herself (which is somewhat ironic considering her position). She even praises a female Time Patroller named Aloe for punching Elder Kai after he had groped them, indicating that she encourages female Time Patrollers to stand up for themselves and not allow Elder Kai to abuse his position within the Time Patrol. However she is not above using his lecherousness to her advantage as she told Xeno Trunks not to say anything about her when he went to ask Elder Kai to assist with the Time Patrol, knowing full well that the old lecher would probably be excited at the prospect of seeing her after 75 million years (it is implied that Elder Kai agreed mainly because he envisioned that Chronoa had become much more attractive over the years which Chronoa apparently took full advantage). Ironically, Elder Kai himself apparently has little interest in Chronoa due to her childlike appearance. While she has changed very little since he last saw her, Elder Kai does mention that she is a bit ruder than in the past, indicating that she was once more respectful towards him in the past.

While she respects Goku and even has a similarly laid back personality, she can be annoyed and frustrated by him at times such as when he tried to eat Tokitoki's Egg after saving it from Mira."
Nishinoya Yuu,"Energetic, Impulsive","Yū Nishinoya is a second-year student at Karasuno High School. He serves as the libero for his school's volleyball team, and is regarded by his teammates as ""Karasuno's Guardian Deity"".

Nishinoya is the shortest member in the team, standing at 159.3 cm (now at 160.5 cm as of chapter 207). Despite his shorter stature, he has a fairly muscular build. He regularly styles his wild dark brown hair by ruffling most of it upwards, adding 10 cm to his height; the tiny tuft of hair that falls over his forehead appears to be bleached a dirty blond. His eyes are brown and slanted.

He tends to wear brightly colored shirts that typically have a random four-character idiom printed on either its front or back, such as ""One-Man Army"" or ""Three-Point Headstand"".

Nishinoya is a very energetic and temperamental person. His boisterous nature and crazy shenanigans can attract unwanted attention quite easily, which often goes badly for him. Although he hardly ever worries about the consequences of his actions, he is surprisingly considerate of his friends' feelings and insecurities.

He has a quirky habit of spontaneously coming up with ridiculous names for the moves he executes while practicing receives. He is also unexpectedly shy when it comes to talking to girls he hasn't met before.

Like Tanaka, Noya has a large interest in Kiyoko Shimizu. Together, they try to approach her but are ultimately ignored. They cause a bit of a ruckus when this happens and are usually scolded by somebody, usually Daichi.

Noya can be extremely impatient, excitable and impulsive. As Tanaka puts it, ""he simply gets too fired up for his own good"". He doesn't bother to filter his words and is therefore prone to blurting out whatever he's thinking in a loud and tactless manner. In-game, however, his attitude changes drastically: he becomes incredibly focused and serious, remaining calm and doing everything in his power to provide the support his team needs until the very end. For this reason, everyone in the volleyball club respects him greatly. He is shown to be incredibly hard-working, once even continuously practicing more than 200 spike-block receives to the point that his legs stopped moving.

Although he displays an incredible feat of confidence and fearlessness countless times, Nishinoya admits to himself that he was a ""huge scaredy-cat"" when he was a kid. He had many fears, which resulted into his grandfather training him so he could overcome those fears, teaching him that behind every fear is a wasted experience, and telling him to never be afraid to ask for help whenever the fear doesn't fade."

Tedd Verres,"Sensitive, Insecure","Tedd Drew Verres is one of the main protagonists of El Goonish Shive and Elliot's best friend. Although (usually) of male sex, Tedd is androgynous in appearance. On account of this, Tedd started wearing special glasses obtained from Mr. Verres (Tedd's dad) so the bullies (e.g. Tony) would be powerless. It didn't work. Tedd met Elliot on the playground, with Elliot defending Tedd against said bullies (Elliot initially identified Tedd as a girl).
After his parent's divorce, Tedd withdrew into himself so much that Nanase thought Tedd was mute. Elliot also commented that Tedd used to mumble a lot, and Tedd's father commented at the time that Tedd barely speaks. When eavesdropping Uryuoms William and Gillian talking with his father, Tedd's loud and enthusiastic offer to help was so surprising that his father decided that the risks of the Transformation Gun were worth the boost of self-confidence it might give him. Tedd agreed to program the Uryuoms' transformation gun to transform them completely so that they would better fit in, and working with the gun indeed helped him. Another big change in Tedd's personality was caused by getting to know Grace.

On account of the teasing resulting from looking androgynous (which often took the form of people accusing Tedd of being gay), Tedd has some issues with the possibility of men being attracted to him (even when one of those men is Grace in a male form).

Tedd has been confirmed to be genderfluid, and Dan has said he should be referred to by the pronouns matching his form, although masculine pronouns will suffice for speaking about Tedd in general."

She displays one of the most aggressive behaviors, in terms of both her fighting style and her attitude towards men, who have been integrated into the Nirvana’s crew, probably more so than Meia. She has a very impressive firearms collection, including a Calico pistol, a CZ 75 pistol, a Steyr AUG, and a Franchi SPAS-12 Shotgun, and is also an excellent cook. During the Second Stage, she voluntarily replaced Gascogne to lead the Registry, after a sortie against a Harvester mothership.

It is not really clear whether Barnette is Jura's girlfriend or best friend, Jura is extremely affectionate with her, but by season 2 it's clear Jura acts that way with anyone she likes. Unlike the three other Dread pilots featured in the series (Dita, Meia, and Jura), her Dread cannot combine with Hibiki's Vanguard, due to her position when the Paeksys altered the Dreads.

While she is friendly towards her friends and other women, her dislike towards the men was more stubborn than the others. She displays one of the most aggressive behaviors of the crew, both in combat and her attitude towards the men, probably more so than Meia. Toward the end of the first season, she helped remind and renew the women's hatred towards their captive men, and lead their attempted recapture.

She has a large collection of classic firearms (including a Calico pistol, a Steyr AUG, and a Franchi SPAS-12 shotgun) and is also a good cook.

She gradually calmed down and mellowed during the second season. She voluntarily replaced Gascogne to lead the crew of the Registry system, after Gascogne was thought to have been lost during a sortie against a Harvester mothership.

When Gascogne was revealed to be alive and returned to the crew, Barnette was pleased to return to her place on the front lines for the final battle against the Harvesters."

So wondrous and majestic were her tapestries, it was said the spinner must have been instructed by the patron Goddess of Weavers herself, Athena. To this comparison, Arachne proudly scoffed, claiming not even the Gods rivaled her talent at weaving.

When Athena heard this, disguised as a crone, she visited Arachne and encouraged her to show proper respect to the Gods. Arachne dismissed the old woman and issued a challenge that no God, not even Athena, could weave better than she. Furious, Athena revealed herself and accepted the challenge.

They both set to the loom with fervor. Athena wove a glorious tapestry depicting her battle with Poseidon over the city of Athens. Her detail and imagery were exquisite. Yet Arachne’s weavings depicted Zeus in his many infidelities with mortals. So flawless, so lifelike was her artistry, not even Athena could refute the skill, nor could she contain her anger at such a sleight. Violently, she tore Arachne’s tapestry and pressed a finger to Arachne’s forehead. Twisting in anguish, Arachne fell to the ground as additional legs grew from her body, screaming as she transformed into the first spider.

It was an act of anger and pity, a lesson and a curse, for spiders are the greatest of weavers, and Arachne, in particular, was to weave for all time, but none could doubt the consequence for Arachne’s pride.

She likes humans and does not have any distaste towards those that hold the notion dear, such as the group wishing to reinstill it as a core value of humanity, but she cannot understand what pleasure they obtain from it. She holds a more practical view that blind love can only lead to failure, instead requiring a method with a tangible benefit shown in how they support each other with a clear objective. Without the ability to see another's heart, she cannot comprehend the idea, so she instead imposes impossible tasks on those seeking her hand, hoping to instead have the suitor measure the love that she cannot. If they are able to retrieve something impossible to obtain that is more valuable than her and still exchange it to have her, she will see that as proof of their need for her and stay with that person for life.

Although she lacks an understanding of love, she feels that she is still happy so long as they are able to live their lives with sun, air, and water, but sometimes feels slightly guilty over that likely being the reason that humanity is declining in the first place.

She is a form of life that inherits the memories of her ancestors as her own, feeling the ""original emotions"" of them as if etched into her genes.

She is an only child and lives with a mother who works as an editor in a publishing company. Among her classmates, Jun carries with her an air of being dependable and straight-laced. She is studious and earns top marks on tests, and can be relied upon by her teacher to help others. However, deep below she is an anxiety-prone girl who easily falls into a tizzy whenever she has to deal with uncomfortable or potentially embarrassing situations. Jun used to avoid hot ramen for the reason that it often fogs her glasses, leaving those around her to poke fun and embarrass her. Being around Koizumi-san can also be considered nerve-wracking for Jun, who is perhaps not used to being around seemingly odd people. (Although it was Koizumi-san who eventually led her to enjoy ramen again.)

Most of her anxiety, however, lies in wrestling with her own future career goals. Even if she is a hard worker, Jun feels that her own achievements would not lead her to become a novelist or be secured a position in her mother's publishing company. She attends a cram school on weekends and feels so anxious during mock exam sessions that her appetite shuts down for an entire day. Jun confides much of these worries to Koizumi-san, who in contrast is more carefree and secretive about her own future.

Nevertheless, when she is among her friends Yuu and Misa, Jun is a little more laid back, and can be seen in the group as the voice of reason."

Probably the epitome of perversion of the entire manga so far, Q and R were completely masochistic and capable to derive insane pleasure from their perverse acts, so much so as to cry out of bliss when Ekaterina confronted them and had them impaled by Anastasia. This revealed the twins to be immortal, as they were capable of regeneration even after the most brutal and grievous wounds in mere seconds, even when killed or torn apart. Being clones of their mistress, they share her power to control the element of mercury. Both Q and R were used by Eva to heal and rebuild herself after her first demise at the hands of Sasha. Another clone, S, appeared during the final confrontation between Sasha and Eva, though she was completely burned, rendering her regeneration useless."

When it came time to design the mascot for our company, I asked the artist who did the Borderline Collection that we published (amazingly, it's still in print, part of the JAST Memorial Collection), and he created Megumi for us, who is totally not named after an ex-girlfriend of mine.

Amiri,"independent, fierce","There are a million ways to die in the Realm of the Mammoth Lords. The natives of this brutal land are the nomadic Kellids, and they have made the best of this primal world. Amiri (pronounced ah-MEE-ree) is one of these barbarians. Although she was blessed with a combination of independence and brawn, Amiri's childhood remained one of constant challenge. To the people of her tribe, the Six Bears, brawn and bravery were not ideal characteristics for a woman to have. To the Six Bears, a woman's role was simple—raise children, tend to the sick, and forge bonds with other tribes. Women were resources. When a tribe wished to form an alliance, they would send gifts of meat, furs, treasure, and daughters. Amiri didn't see herself as livestock, and every chance she got, she tried to one-up her brothers and cousins. When a hunter went out and caught a caribou for the tribe, she would go out and catch two. When a party of orc raiders stumbled into their hunting grounds and a tribal hero killed four, she took it upon herself to kill six. Her constant sense of competition made her few friends—her brothers were both intimidated by her ferocity and enthralled by her beauty, while her sisters knew that each time she went against tradition, they would all be punished.

When Amiri finally came of age, her reputation had spread beyond the Six Bears. The other tribes took to calling her the ""Soft Chieftain"" of the Six Bears, a name that humiliated her almost as much as it did her kin, inferring that they were weak for allowing one of their women to grow so independent and strong. None of the other tribes wanted any part of her—her continued presence among the Six Bears caused much strife between once friendly tribes, and so the elders determined that there was but one choice — Amiri had to die. The only problem was the commonly held belief that murder of one's kin was the greatest taboo and the surest path to Hell.

The opportunity to be rid of their troublesome sister rose soon enough, when word came of a tribe of frost giants who had been sighted in the nearby mountains. The elders organized a warband to scout the mountains and to drive back the giants, and they made sure that Amiri was included in the band. Shocked but proud to have finally been chosen, Amiri didn't notice how the elders smiled at her eagerness to be on her way. The elders knew that Amiri's sense of competition would swiftly get her in over her head, and in secret tasked the rest of the hunters to goad her into just such a situation.

The warband headed up into the Kodar foothills, and it wasn't long before they found evidence of giants. One morning, the leader of the band rushed into camp, waving a dagger the size of a man's arm over his head. The warrior claimed to have single-handedly slain a giant and to have taken his dagger, and the others in the band congratulated him on his skill and bravery. Amiri took the bait, and announced that she would return by sundown with an even greater weapon. She could have no way of knowing that the dagger was part of the deception—that the warband had brought it with them as a prop to incite her into a foolish plan.

What the warband themselves didn't anticipate was that Amiri would find a frost giant. After wandering the mountains, she came to an immense body at the foot of a cliff—the giant had fallen to his death weeks before, and at his side lay his immense bastard sword. Although Amiri knew that she had not killed the giant, she also knew that all she needed was his sword as proof—certainly her kin wouldn't think to dispute her claim with such a grand trophy. Yet when she returned to the place she had left her kin, she found the camp empty. Concerned, worried that they had fallen victim to the region's dangers, she tracked them, catching up with the warband halfway back to the tribal camp. As she approached the camp, though, she realized something was amiss—they were talking of her, and they were laughing.

Creeping unseen to the edge of the camp, she realized that she had been duped. She heard her kin mocking her ways, of how she had fallen for their ruse, and how even now she was likely cooking in a giant's stew pot. That they seemed grateful and so at ease with her death was not what enraged Amiri. It was the proof that her own people thought of her as a fool that did it. Eyes blazing, Amiri stepped into the camp and held her new sword out, proclaiming that even now she had bested them. The other warriors, shocked to see her alive, quickly fell back to laughter, pointing out that she could hardly wield such an ungainly weapon. Her fury growing, Amiri hefted the weapon and tried to adopt a menacing pose, but the weapon's size threw her off balance and she toppled over, much to the other barbarian's growing amusement.

It was enough. With a roar, Amiri leapt back to her feet. Her rage filled her body, clouded her vision, stole over her soul. Two of the barbarians had been decapitated by her immense sword before they realized that death had come. The battle was swift and brutal, with Amiri not noticing the blows that landed on her, simply stepping from one traitor to the next and cutting them down.

When her rage finally subsided, Amiri realized what she had done. She knew that the hunters had certainly deserved their fates, but they were still kin. That her reasons for murdering them were, to her, valid didn't change the ties of blood. She knew that she had cut those ties, and so she turned her back on the remains, trusting that they would be discovered by another hunting party soon enough. As she headed west into the lands of Irrisen and the unknown reaches beyond, her heart was for the first time free—no longer was her future tied to traditions that would constrain her. She has come to value her over sized sword, and even though she can only truly wield it properly when her blood rage takes her, it has become as much a part of her as her fierce independence or her fiery heart. She no longer sees herself as a member of the Six Bears, but never speaks of the circumstances that forced her to flee her homeland. Some things are better left unsaid."
